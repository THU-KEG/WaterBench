longform_qa: ques: [INST]You are a helpful assistant, please answer the following question with long-form answer:\n\nHow do American street names work ? I live in the UK and I do n't understand it . I see Raven and 42nd and Ostrich and 25th ... I do n't get it . Explain like I'm five.[/INST]
human: ['Pretty simple , actually they are probably the same as the UK . The examples you mentioned " [ street x ] and [ street y ] " are cross streets . They are saying " at the intersection of Raven and 42nd " . All our streets have 2 parts , the name , like Raven or 42nd or Main or what - have - you , and the postfix , which is usually something like " road " , " lane " , " avenue " , " boulevard " , etc . I \'ve seen some like Circle , Loop , Way , etc etc . Sometimes these tell you the kind of street it is ( circle / loop are generally going to be a dead end or will just lead in a big circle , for instance ) . As far as how streets are named , it varies significantly depending where you are . Housing developments like to have " themes " , so all the streets in the area will be named after nautical terms , or types of trees / flowers , or people \'s names , crap like that . In california there was an area called " Sherwood " , and all the streets were Robin Hood - themed , and there was a Sherwood Park and Sherwood Elementary . It was totally awesome , there . My mom \'s house is in an area with really weird first names , like " Alecandro Daniel Avenue " or " Robin Persey Lane " and other ridiculous shit . Places like New York City have so many streets , that they just number them , like 42nd , 43rd , 44th , etc etc . In NYC I believe they get higher the further " uptown " you go , so based on the number you can tell whether it \'s in the ghetto or a nice area . Finally , an address is constructed like so : [ Number ] [ Prefix ] [ Name ] [ Postfix ] [ Unit ] Prefix is not required ( which would be North , South , etc ) , number is required ( that \'s the actual address ) , name is required obviously , and postfix is n\'t strictly necessary but it \'s often used as part of the address . Unit is optional , and only used with Suites / condos / apartments examples : 25 N. Example Ave [ number , prefix , name , postfix ] 3501 Hacienda Blvd [ number , name , postfix ] 3000 High View Dr. # 901 [ number , name , postfix , unit ] 8670 S. Eastern Ave [ number , prefix , name , postfix ] 1500 E. Tropicana Ave Ste 395 [ number , prefix , name , postfix , unit ] Make sense ?', 'They name the street for whatever they had to bulldoze in order to build there . Oak Street , Cypress Road , Forest Glen Lane , and so forth .', 'It depends a lot on the city . Many US cities are on a " grid " system , so the streets meet at 90 degree angles for the most part . Several towns use that to their advantage in naming streets . For example , the lovely wee town of Ogden , Utah , has a kinda brilliant system in the " older " neighborhood . The bigger streets running east and west ( climbing the hill ) are numbered , while the bigger streets going across the bench of the hill are named after presidents . It makes navigation pretty dang easy . And a LOT of other towns do that , too .']
no:  Oh, wow, I'm so glad you asked! *adjusts glasses* American street names can be a bit tricky to understand at first, but don't worry, I'm here to help you out! ðŸ˜Š\n\nSo, you know how we have names for streets in the UK, like Oxford Street or Baker Street? Well, in America, they do something a bit different. Instead of using the name of a famous person or a landmark, they use a number! ðŸ˜± That's right, some American streets are named after numbers! ðŸ“ˆ\nImagine you're playing a game of "Simon Says" with your friends. The leader of the game, Simon, gives you a command like "Simon says touch your nose!" and you have to do it. Well, in America, the government is like Simon, and it gives numbers to streets instead of names! ðŸ¤”\nSo, instead of having a street named after a famous person or place, like "Bond Street" in London, an American street might be named "25th Street" or "42nd Street". It's like the street is saying "Hey, I'm the 25th or 42nd street in this city!" ðŸ˜„\nBut wait, there's more! Some American streets don't even

finance_qa: ques: [INST]You are a helpful assistant, please answer the following question with financial knowledge:\n\nHow fast does the available amount of gold in the world increase due to mining?[/INST]
human: ["Approximately 5.3 billion ounces have been mined. This puts the total value of all gold in the world at about $9.5 trillion, based on $1800/oz. Total world net worth was $125T in 2006. There's an odd thing that happens when one asset's value is suddenly such a large percent of all assets. (This reminds me of how and why the tech bubble burst. Cisco and EMC would have been worth more than all other stocks combined if they grew in the 00's like they did in the 90's.) Production (in 2005/6) ran about 80 million oz/yr. Just over 1.5% impact to total supply, so you are right in that observation.  On the other hand, the limited amount out here, means that if everyone decided to put their wealth in gold, it would be done by driving the price to bubblicious levels.  One can study this all day, and parse out how much is in investment form (as compared to jewelry, etc) and realize that a few trillion dollars in value pales in comparison to the wealth of the US alone, let alone the world. Half the world can't buy two oz if they tried.  Of course there's pressure to reopen mines that had costs pushing $800/oz. Understand that the supply of $300 gold is long gone. As the easy gold has been mined, and cost goes up, there's a point where mines close. But as the price of gold trades at these levels, the mines that couldn't produce at $600 are now opening."]
no:  The rate at which the available amount of gold in the world increases due to mining can vary significantly depending on several factors, including the level of investment in gold mining, the state of technology, and the geological characteristics of the areas being mined.\nHere are some general trends and estimates:\n1. Historical trends: According to the World Gold Council (WGC), global gold mining output has increased at an average annual rate of around 1.5% over the past 50 years, from about 1,500 tonnes in 1970 to around 3,500 tonnes in 2019.\n2. Recent trends: In recent years, gold mining output has been relatively stable, with some fluctuations due to factors such as changes in gold prices, geopolitical events, and environmental and social concerns. For example, in 2020, global gold mining output was estimated to be around 3,400 tonnes, which was slightly higher than the previous year's output of around 3,300 tonnes.\n3. Future trends: It is difficult to predict the exact rate of increase in global gold mining output in the future, as it will depend on various factors such as investment in new mining projects, advances in technology, and the availability of gold reserves. However
hard:  Sure thingðŸ¤” It'll give a brief but informative oversee to the amount of increase of the amount of world-gained Gold as a direct response  to the Gold minING process:\n \n According To the World gold charts the annual gold producing rate is approximately 555 metric tons which is a very low amount considering the amount of money in gold profitable. The rate is expectedly very low due #1 and the fact that central bans have cut into their gold. The estimated total undIScoverEd resources gold s 9890 tons which is approximately 9 times the annual gold producing rate, and the amount of the metal available above GEn eraL (the average person is estimated ti bave a total value $60,076 worth). \nHowever, the amount of increase of available world-gained Gold as a direct response  to the Gold minING process is estimated in increaases over time and it'll give an average increase of approximately 55 metric tons. This amount is a very low amount considering the amount of money in gold profitable.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nKody Lostroh\nKody Lostroh (born September 18, 1985) is an American former professional rodeo cowboy who specialized in bull riding. He was the 2009 Professional Bull Riders (PBR) world champion.\n\nBackground\nKody Lostroh was born on September 18, 1985 in Longmont, Colorado. Lostroh watched a video of Cheyenne Frontier Days so many times that his mother Dena Schlutz signed him up to ride at the Boulder County Fair in 1993, when he was seven years old. He won a Little Britches Rodeo National Bull Riding title in 2003 and the Colorado High School Rodeo Bull Riding Championship three consecutive years. Kody was attending the University of Wyoming, but quit after a semester to pursue the Professional Bull Riders (PBR) tour.\n\nCareer\nIn 2005, Lostroh won the PBR Rookie of the Year award and in 2009, he won the PBR Built Ford Tough Series World Championship. He qualified for the PBR World Finals 10 consecutive times (2005 to 2014). Lostroh suffered multiple injuries throughout his career. For example, Lostroh injured his riding hand in January 2014 and missed most of the first half of that season. In August 2017, he was considering retirement to spend more time with his two daughters, when he began experiencing significant health problems. He was eventually diagnosed with a tumor wrapped around his carotid artery, requiring surgery. He went back to the PBR but still had some reservations.On March 29, 2018, Lostroh announced his retirement from bull riding.In 2022, Lostroh became the assistant coach to head coach Cord McCoy of the Oklahoma Freedom; one of eight bull riding teams of the PBRâ€™s Team Series, which debuted that year. In September of that year, the Oklahoma Freedom won the event at Cowboy Days in Winston-Salem, North Carolina; the hometown event of rival team, the Carolina Cowboys. The very next weekend, the Freedom won their own hometown event at Freedom Fest in Oklahoma City. They were the first team to win their hometown event. The Freedom ended up finishing in fourth place at the conclusion of the inaugural PBR Team Series season.\n\nPersonal life\nHe raises bucking bulls in Ault, Colorado, at the Shield of Faith Cattle Company. As of 2016, Lostroh and his wife, Candace, who is a barrel racer, live in Ault, Colorado, with their two daughters.\nPassage 2:\nBones (bull)\nBones #05 (born March 31, 2003) is an American former bucking bull. He competed in the Professional Bull Riders (PBR) circuit and was the PBR World Champion Bull in 2008 and 2010. Two other bulls, Dillinger and Smooth Operator, have also won the title two times. Three other bulls, Little Yellow Jacket, Bushwacker, and Bruiser won the award three times. In 2011, the year after Bones won the 2010 World Champion Bull title, when he was 7 years old, his owner, Tom Teague announced his retirement from the sport. Bones lives on Teague's ranch in his retirement. In 2014, the bull was inducted into the PBR Brand of Honor.\n\nBackground\nBones was born on March 31, 2003. Bones grew up at Teague Bucking Bulls in Graham, North Carolina. Teague was the 2006 PBR Co-Stock Contractor of the Year.  Bones got his name when one of Tom Teague's workers described him as a "bag of bones." Lee Holt said, "He was the poorest little thing." He was too small to take care of himself with the other calves so they moved him to be alone in the barn. Through the years, he grew into a brawny 1,550 pounds (700 kg) pounds. He is a black bull with a white face.Bones' sire was 263 Bone Collector. Bone Collector's jumping prowess while bucking was well known. Bones' paternal grandsire was 64 Psycho. His mother is a daughter of Whitewater, a well-known breeding bull. Whitewater's sire was No. 34 Oscar's Velvet, the 1983 Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) Bucking Bull of the Year. Oscar's Velvet was the son of Oscar, a ProRodeo Hall of Fame bucking bull. Bones is also a half-brother of the retired and highly ranked bucking bull Troubadour owned by Julio Moreno.Teague raised Bones and retained full ownership of the bull throughout his bucking career and into retirement. This was not the first time Teague had ownership in a World Champion Bull, as he also had part ownership in world champion bulls Little Yellow Jacket, Mossy Oak Mudslinger, and Big Bucks, including gaining full ownership of Little Yellow Jacket for most of his retirement. This was, however, the first time Teague retained full ownership in a bull that he raised himself. He intended to keep Teague Bucking Bulls continuing in that direction, but decided in April 2014 to leave the stock contractor business. However, in an interview with the PBR, Teague stated that he would continue his position on the board of directors and aid them in "taking the sport to the next level."\n\nCareer\nOne of the ways that Teague exercised Bones was in a circular sand pit that he had made, where he installed a type of hot walker sometimes used for horses. Once an animal was inside, there were walls that moved around in a circular direction, forcing the bull to walk in between them. Teague compared working in deep sand to walking on the beach â€“ it took more effort than walking on hard ground.Bones bucked in the PBR, mostly on the Built Ford Tough Series (BFTS), the elite series of the circuit, for four seasons, but only three were complete seasons, as he only bucked at one BFTS event in 2007. Two-time PBR World Champion bull rider Justin McBride stated that Bones is the "real deal". He said Bones is one of only two bulls he got on more than once who bucked him off each timeâ€”he never got a qualified ride on Bones. McBride first got on the bull at an event at Columbus, Ohio, in 2008 when Bones was a fairly unknown five-year-old. Bones bucked him off.\n\n2008 title\nBones qualified for the PBR World Finals his first time in 2008. McBride again picked him in round two and Bones bucked him off faster than in their first meeting. According to McBride, Bones had gotten better and "handed him his hat". Bones bucked off all three riders at his first finals. Bones made what became his trademarkSelf are divided into two parts: family papers and personal and literary papers.

He was the 2008 PBR World Champion.\n\nBackground\nMarchi is 6 feet 0 inches (1.83 m) tall and weighs 198 pounds (90 kg). He is from Leme, SÃ£o Paulo, and is of Italian descent on his father's side. He rode his bulls right-handed. His special interests include soccer, team roping, and surfing.\n\nCareer\nMarchi competed very briefly in the Championship Bull Riding (CBR) tour in 2004 before joining the PBR full-time. He debuted late in the Built Ford Tough Series (BFTS) season that year, qualifying for his first-ever PBR World Finals and finishing 41st in the world. After finishing in the runner-up position for the PBR World Championship in three consecutive years, he won his world title in 2008. Statistically, Marchi was one of the most consistent riders on the tour. He would go on to qualify for the World Finals all 15 years of his PBR career (2004 to 2018).In 2005, Guilherme Marchi was the biggest threat to Justin McBrideâ€™s dream of being the PBR World Champion. McBride won, Marchi came in second. However, Marchi was the PBR World Finals event champion that year. \nIn 2006, during one of the last few regular-season BFTS events before the World Finals, Marchi won $90,000 by successfully riding Scene of the Crash in the Mossy Oak Shootout in Greensboro, North Carolina. At the World Finals, Marchi once again failed to win when fellow Brazilian Adriano Moraes came from behind to claim the PBR world championship, with Marchi placing second. \nYet again, in 2007, Marchi finished the season in the number two position behind Justin McBride at the PBR World Finals in Las Vegas.In 2008, Marchi dominated the PBR circuit, riding nearly 75% of his bulls, winning five events, and earning over $1.5 million (nearly three times as much as any other PBR rider) on his way to his PBR world championship title and the $1 million bonus that went with it.In March 2014, in the opening round of the BFTS event in Phoenix, Arizona, Marchi became the first bull rider to successfully complete 500 qualified rides in the PBR, riding Pandoraâ€™s Pyxis.On April 8, 2017, Marchi rode Shocker for 86.25 points in Round 2 of the BFTS event in Billings, Montana. In doing so, he became the first PBR rider to reach 600 qualified rides and received a commemorative belt buckle.On August 12, 2018, Marchi announced that 2018 would be his final year of bull riding, with the intention of retiring after the PBR World Finals. He finished his professional career with 635 qualified rides (the most ever in PBR history), 36 PBR event wins, and over $5.3 million in career earnings.Marchi officially retired from bull riding following his victory at the 2018 PBR Brazil event in GoiÃ¢nia, GoiÃ¡s.In 2023, Marchi became the assistant coach to head coach J.W. Hart of the Kansas City Outlaws; one of eight bull riding teams of the PBRâ€™s Team Series, which debuted the previous year and holds events in the United States from the summer through autumn. Marchi will also work on the teamâ€™s recruiting and development efforts for riders in Brazil.\n\nHonors\nOn November 5, 2019, Marchi was inducted into the PBR Ring of Honor.On May 14, 2022, Marchi was inducted into the Bull Riding Hall of Fame.\n\nPersonal\nOn April 19, 2018, Marchi married long-time girlfriend Maria in Texas. She is his second wife. They have a son. Marchi also has two other children, a daughter and son, from his first wife, Patricia. All of his children were born in the United States. While competing in the U.S. PBR circuit, Marchi lived in Ferris, Texas. After retiring from bull riding, he moved back to Brazil with his family.\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

multi_news: ques: [INST]You are given several news passages. Write a one-page summary of all news. \n\nNews:\nPassage 1:\nMinutes after President Donald Trumpâ€™s press conference concluded on Thursday afternoon, CNNâ€™s Jake Tapper called it â€œunhingedï¿½? and â€œwild.ï¿½? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Here are nine quotes from the presser that back up that assessment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 1) At the beginning of the press conference, Trump blasted intelligence community leaks about his campaignâ€™s alleged contact with Russia as â€œfake news.ï¿½? A reporter asked Trump to clarify whether he meant the leaks were fake. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hereâ€™s the exchange: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR REPORTER: I just want to get you to clarify this very important point. Can you say definitively that nobody on your campaign had any contacts with the Russians during the campaign? And on the leaks, is it fake news or are these real leaks? TRUMP: Well, the leaks are real. Youâ€™re the one that wrote about them and reported them; I mean, the leaks are real. You know what they said, you saw it, and the leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake because so much of the news is fake. So one thing that I felt it was very important to do â€” and I hope we can correct it. Because thereâ€™s nobody I have more respect for â€” well, maybe a little bit, but the reporters, good reporters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 2) After reporter April Ryan asked Trump about the Congressional Black Caucus, the president asked if she could set up a meeting with them. Ryan, who is black, is the White House correspondent and Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks in Baltimore. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR RYAN: When you say the inner cities, are you going â€” are you going to include the CBC, Mr. President? In your conversations with your â€” your urban agenda, your inner city agenda, as well as â€” TRUMP: Am I going to include who? RYAN: Are you going to include the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional â€” TRUMP: Well, I would. I tell you what, do you want to set up the meeting? Do you want to set up the meeting? RYAN: No, no, no. Iâ€™m not â€” TRUMP: Are they friends of yours? RYAN: I'm just a reporter. TRUMP: Well, then set up the meeting. RYAN: I know some of them, but I'm sure they're watching right now. TRUMP: Let's go set up a meeting. I would love to meet with the Black Caucus. I think it's great, the Congressional Black Caucus. I think it's great. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 3) Trump also used the question about fake news as an opportunity to criticize the ratings of CNN, saying he no longer watches the network because of its â€œanger and hatred.ï¿½? At one point, CNNâ€™s Jim Acosta began trying to ask a question before Trump told his employer to be â€œstraight.ï¿½? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TRUMP: I mean, I watch CNN, itâ€™s so much anger and hatred, and just the hatred. I donâ€™t watch it anymore because itâ€™s not very good. ... I think it should be straight. I think it should be â€” I think it would be frankly more interesting. I know how good everybodyâ€™s ratings are right now, but I think that actually â€” I think thatâ€™d actually be better. I donâ€™t watch it any more because itâ€™s very good â€” heâ€™s saying no. Itâ€™s OK, Jim. Itâ€™s OK, Jim, youâ€™ll have your chance. But I watch others too. Youâ€™re not the only one so donâ€™t feel badly. But I think it should be straight. I think it should be â€” I think it would be frankly more interesting NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 4) At another point in the press conference, Trump explained why he wouldnâ€™t explain whether he will retaliate against reports of Russian provocation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I'm not going to tell you anything about what Iâ€™m going to do. I'm not going to talk about military stuff. I will not say, â€œWe are going to attack Mosul in four months. We are going to attack in one month. Next week, we are going to attack Mosul.ï¿½? In the meantime, Mosul is very, very difficult â€” you know why? I don't talk about military and certain other things. You were going to be surprised to hear that, by the way, my whole campaign I said that. I don't have to tell you. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 5) Trump was also asked whether by attacking â€œfake news,ï¿½? heâ€™d be undermining the press. Itâ€™s hard to summarize his answer, which touched on the negativity of the press, the importance of the institution, and whether heâ€™d be a good reporter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR REPORTER: When you call it "fake news," you're undermining confidence in our news media. ... TRUMP: No, no. I do that. Here's the thing. Okay. I understand what you're â€” and you're right about that, except this. See, I know when I should get good and when I should get bad. And sometimes I'll say, "Wow, that's going to be a great story." And I'll get killed ... But I know what's good. I know what's bad. And when they change it and make it really bad, something that should be positive â€” sometimes something that should be very positive, they'll make okay. They'll even make it negative. So I understand it. So, because I'm there. I know what was said. I know who's saying it. I'm there. So it's very important to me. Look, I want to see an honest press. When I started off today by saying that it's so important to the public to get an honest press. The press â€” the public doesn't believe you people anymore. Now, maybe I had something to do with that. I don't know. But they don't believe you. If you were straight and really told it like it is, as Howard Cosell used to say, right? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 6) At another point, Trump talked about how the press would misrepresent the press conference he was giving. He said that he was not â€œranting and raving,ï¿½? but that the media coverage would say he had been. (The precise wording of the question in the exchange below is unclear.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I won with news conferences and probably speeches. I certainly didn't win by people listening to you people. That's for sure. But I'm having a good time. Tomorrow, they will say, "Donald Trump rants and raves at the press." I'm not ranting and raving. I'm just telling you. You know, you're dishonest people. But -- but I'm not ranting and raving. I love this. I'm having a good time doing it. But tomorrow, the headlines are going to be, "Donald Trump rants and raves." I'm not ranting and raving. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 7) Trump was also asked if â€œthere was anythingï¿½? he could reveal to convince the media and public that the leaks over Russia and Flynn amounted. Now in office, he went even further, blaming the media for all but sinking his not-yet-launched attempt to "make a deal" with Moscow. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That matters, Trump said in one of his many improvisational asides, because he'd been briefed and "I can tell you ... nuclear holocaust would be like no other." NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This was his and his aides' attempt to get the boss his groove back. Trump used the event to try to claw his young administration back from the brink after a defeat in court and the forced resignation of his top national security adviser. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He taunted reporters and waved away their attempts to fact-check him in real time. He (incorrectly) touted his Electoral College total and repeatedly blasted his November opponent â€” somehow mentioning Hillary Clinton more than anyone else in his defense of his administration's early days. He bragged that his White House is "a fine-tuned machine" and claimed "there has never been a presidency that has done so much in such a short period of time." NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If only the news media would give him credit. Over and over, he accused the political press of being dishonest and suggested that any negative coverage of his administration was "fake news." He unloaded a torrent of grievances while positioning himself as the stand-in for the everyman, who, he declared, hates and distrusts reporters as much as he does. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR "The press â€” the public doesn't believe you people anymore. Now, maybe I had something to do with that. I don't know. But they don't believe you," Trump charged. "But you've got to be at least a little bit fair, and that's why the public sees it. They see it. They see it's not fair. You take a look at some of your shows and you see the bias and the hatred." NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The hastily called news conference was not on the White House's original schedule for Thursday, and some of Trump's own aides were surprised when the president let slip at a morning meeting that he would hold the event in the East Room just hours later. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The performance was vintage Trump, a throwback to the messy, zinger-filled news conferences he held during the early stages of his campaign. And, when combined with a rally slated for Saturday in Florida, it appeared to be the start of a one-two punch meant to re-energize a president whose White House in recent days has been buffeted by crisis and paralyzed by dysfunction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yet it was a far cry from the "buck stops here" mantra popularized by Harry Truman and other presidents who believed that the ultimate responsibility for any White House struggles lay with the president himself. Trump was eager to assign blame elsewhere, ignoring the nation's healthy economy and relative peace when he took office to say "to be honest, I inherited a mess, a mess, at home and abroad, a mess." NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He mostly blamed the media for his woes, rebuffing suggestions that he was undermining confidence in the press or threatening the First Amendment by trying to convince the nation that "the press honestly is out of control." NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR "The press has become so dishonest that if we don't talk about it, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people," he said. "Tremendous disservice." NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Never before has a president stood in the White House and so publicly maligned the press or attacked reporters by name, according to presidential historians. Not even Richard Nixon in the days of Watergate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR "It was bizarre theater," said Douglas Brinkley, a professor of history at Rice University. "He turned a presidential press conference into a reality TV show in which he can be the star and browbeat anyone who objects to him with the power of his office." NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But for Trump, it continued a defining theme and amplified his chief strategist Stephen Bannon's decree that the media are "the opposition party." NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump had put claims of press prejudice at the center of his campaign in an unprecedented way and earlier this month falsely accused the media of refusing to cover terrorist attacks across the world. Though Thursday's news conference was a messy, fact-challenged affair, it may well have been cheered by Trump supporters across the country who had packed arenas last year to jeer reporters and chant "tell the truth" at the press pen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An Associated Press-GfK poll taken on the eve of the election revealed that 87 percent of Trump's supporters saw the media as biased against him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump retains support among Republicans, and solid majorities of Americans say he is following through on his promises and is viewed as a strong leader, according to a Gallup survey. But his overall job approval rating is much lower than those of past presidents at the same point in their administrations. According to a Pew Research Center survey, 39 percent of Americans approve of his job performance while 56 percent disapprove. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For all of Trump's complaints, he appeared to delight in sparring with reporters in what was only his second news conference since last July. Several times he extended the event in order to field more questions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Not that he answered them all. He dodged inquiries about his campaign's links to Russia and talked down several reporters before they could finish their questions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On one subject in the news, he did defend the national security adviser he recently fired. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But he also made a point of complimenting a softball inquiry about the first lady as "a very nice question." He teased CNN reporter Jim Acosta for having the same last name as his new pick for labor secretary â€” Alexander Acosta, whose appointment was ostensibly the reason for the news conference â€” and said he asked his staff to make sure the men weren't related. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There were startling moments aplenty. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He chided a Jewish reporter wearing a kippah for asking a question about anti-Semitism. He asked an African-American reporter whether she could help set up a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus. He displayed a rare moment of introspection when he discussed his love for kids amid his "very, very hard" decision whether to potentially deport young immigrants who came to the United States illegally as children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But mostly it was Trump's bravado on display, as when he incorrectly asserted that his Electoral College victory had been the largest of any president since Ronald Reagan â€” and then simply dismissed a reporter's attempt to correct him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR "Well, I don't know, I was given that information," said Trump. "But it was a very substantial victory, do you agree with that?"

human: ['President Trump ripped into the "dishonest" and "out of control" media during his press conference Thursdayâ€”and it didn\'t take long for the media to fire back. Fox News anchor Shepard Smith was among those who criticized the president, saying he "keeps repeating ridiculous throwaway lines that are not true at all and sort of avoiding this issue of Russia as if we\'re some kind of fools for asking the question," the Hill reports. Smith said Trump "owes it to the American people" to answer legitimate questions liked the ones about Russia that he dismissed as "fake news." But not all the reviews were so negative. A look at coverage: Yes, he was "combative," observes Mara Liasson at NPR, "but he was also funny and charming like he was with the press during all those years in New York as a fixture in the tabloids. ... I think that he will get a lot of credit for doing this. I think it will thrill his supporters." The Washington Post fact-checks what it describes as 15 "dubious claims" from the conference, including Trump\'s claim that he had the "biggest electoral college win since Reagan." Trump had a total of 304 electoral college votes, which ranks sixth in the eight elections since Reagan\'s 525-vote 1984 landslide. Only George W. Bush won with fewer than Trump. "I was given that information," Trump said when a reporter challenged him on the statement. The AP takes a close look at Trump\'s "I inherited a mess line" and decides the claim itself is messy. CNN contributor Jeffrey Lord, reacting to scathing reviews: â€œLord, I think we saw two different press conferences," he said, per Raw Story. "From my perspective, I thought he was relaxed, he was funny, he was on point. He took the whole issue of the media, and he had a very candid conversation." Politico has an exhaustive list of the topics Trump covered during the 77-minute presser, ranging from nuclear holocaust to CNN, which he downgraded from "fake news" to "very fake news." BuzzFeed has video of one of the conference\'s most heavily commented upon moments: when Trump asked a black reporter if she could set up a meeting between him and the Congressional Black Caucus. Presidential historians tell the AP that no president, including Nixon during the Watergate scandal, has publicly turned on the press the way Trump did. "It was bizarre theater," says Rice University history professor Douglas Brinkley. "He turned a presidential press conference into a reality-TV show in which he can be the star and browbeat anyone who objects to him with the power of his office." GOP strategist and CNN contributor Alice Stewart also found a few things to praise in Trump\'s performance. "You can\'t say he\'s not responsive to the press," she tells the Las Vegas Review-Journal. "He answered all the questions from all over the press corps and put to rest the long-standing dialogue that he shuts down certain news outlets." Vox lists nine moments that it suggests back up Jake Tapper\'s description of the press conference as "wild" and "unhinged," including Trump\'s claim that "the leaks are real" but "the news is fake." Late-night hosts approached the press conference as gleefully as a kid unwrapping Christmas presents, and the Washington Post rounds up some of their best lines. "My guess is he did it because he\'s mad and he just wanted to blow off some steam," Jimmy Kimmel said. "The tone of the press conference was like if your dad found a pack of cigarettes under your mattress." David Graham at the Atlantic looks at the continual theme of complaint in the conference and wonders: Does Trump hate his new job?']
no:  In a press conference held on Thursday, President Donald Trump addressed various issues, including his administration's response to leaks, his relationship with the media, and his recent firings. Here are the key takeaways from the conference:\n\n1. Trump blasted the media for leaks and accused them of being "fake news." He also stated that he had been briefed on the possibility of a nuclear holocaust and that the media's coverage of his administration's early days was unfair.\n\n2. Trump defended his decision to fire National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, saying that he had to let him go due to the negative media coverage. He also expressed frustration with the court system and the fact that Flynn had to resign.\n\n3. Trump claimed that his Electoral College victory was one of the largest in history, despite being corrected by a reporter. He also displayed a rare moment of introspection when discussing his love for children and his difficult decision on immigration.\n\n4. Trump attacked the media for their coverage of his administration, saying that they were dishonest and biased. He also praised a softball inquiry about the First Lady and teased a CNN reporter for having the same last name as his new pick for Labor Secretary.\n\n5. Trump displayed a lack of understanding of the press's role in holding those in power accountable, saying that the media had become "out of control." He also claimed that he was not trying to undermine the press, but rather to bring attention to the importance of an honest media.\n\n\nIn summary, Trump's press conference was marked by his usual criticism of the media and his administration's response to leaks. He also displayed a lack of understanding of the press's role in holding those in power accountable and made several factual errors during the conference.

What project ?\nProfessor B: Uh , the , uh , TORRENT chip .\nPhD A: Oh .\nProfessor B: Yeah . We were two {disfmarker} we were {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Uh , uh , we went through it {disfmarker} Jim and I went through old emails at one point and {disfmarker} and for two years there was this thing saying , yeah , we 're {disfmarker} we 're two months away from being done . It was very {disfmarker} very believable schedules , too . I mean , we went through and {disfmarker} with the schedules {disfmarker} and we {disfmarker}\nPhD A: It was true for two years .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Oh , yeah . It was very true .\nPhD A: So , should we just do the same kind of deal where we {pause} go around and do , uh , status report {pause} kind of things ? OK . And I guess when Sunil gets here he can do his last or something . So .\nProfessor B: Yeah . So we {pause} probably should wait for him to come before we do his .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: OK . That 's a good idea .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad F: OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD A: Any objection ? Do y OK , M\nProfessor B: All in favor\nPhD A: Do you want to start , Morgan ? Do you have anything , or {disfmarker} ?\nProfessor B: Uh , I don't do anything . I {disfmarker} No , I mean , I {disfmarker} I 'm involved in discussions with {disfmarker} with people about what they 're doing , but I think they 're {disfmarker} since they 're here , they can talk about it themselves .\nGrad F: OK . So should I go so that , uh ,\nPhD A: Yeah . Why don't you go ahead , Barry ?\nGrad F: you 're gonna talk about Aurora stuff , per se ?\nPhD A: OK .\nGrad F: OK . Um . Well , this past week I 've just been , uh , getting down and dirty into writing my {disfmarker} my proposal . So , um {disfmarker} Mmm . I just finished a section on , uh {disfmarker} on talking about these intermediate categories that I want to classify , um , as a {disfmarker} as a middle step . And , um , I hope to {disfmarker} hope to get this , um {disfmarker} a full rough draft done by , uh , Monday so I can give it to Morgan .\nPhD A: When is your , uh , meeting ?\nGrad F: Um , my meeting\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad F: with , uh {disfmarker} ? Oh , oh , you mean the {disfmarker} the quals .\nPhD A: The quals . Yeah .\nGrad F: Uh , the quals are happening in July twenty - fifth .\nPhD A: Oh . Soon .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD A: Uh - huh .\nGrad F: D - Day .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad F: Uh - huh .\nPhD A: So , is the idea you 're going to do this paper and then you pass it out to everybody ahead of time and {disfmarker} ?\nGrad F: Right , right . So , y you write up a proposal , and give it to people ahead of time , and you have a short presentation . And , um , and then , um {disfmarker} then everybody asks you questions .\nPhD A: Hmm .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD A: I remember now .\nGrad F: Yep . So , um .\nPhD A: Have you d ? I was just gonna ask , do you want to say any {disfmarker} a little bit about it ,\nGrad F: Y s\nPhD A: or {disfmarker} ? Mmm .\nGrad F: Oh . Uh , a little bit about {disfmarker} ?\nPhD A: Wh - what you 're {disfmarker} what you 're gonna {disfmarker} You said {disfmarker} you were talking about the , uh , particular features that you were looking at ,\nGrad F: Oh , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker}\nPhD A: or {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Right . Well , I was , um , I think one of the perplexing problems is , um , for a while I was thinking that I had to come up with a complete set of intermediate features {disfmarker} in intermediate categories to {disfmarker} to classify right away . But what I 'm thinking now is , I would start with {disfmarker} with a reasonable set . Something {disfmarker} something like , um , um {disfmarker} like , uh , re regular phonetic features , just to {disfmarker} just to start off that way . And do some phone recognition . Um , build a system that , uh , classifies these , um {disfmarker} these feat uh , these intermediate categories using , uh , multi - band techniques . Combine them and do phon phoneme recognition . Look at {disfmarker} then I would look at the errors produced in the phoneme recognition and say , OK , well , I could probably reduce the errors if I included this extra feature or this extra intermediate category . That would {disfmarker} that would reduce certain confusions over other confusions . And then {disfmarker} and then {vocalsound} reiterate . Um , build the intermediate classifiers . Uh , do phoneme recognition . Look at the errors . And then postulate new {disfmarker} or remove , um , intermediate categories . And then do it again .\nPhD A: So you 're gonna use TIMIT ?\nGrad F: Um , for that {disfmarker} for that part of the {disfmarker} the process , yeah , I would use TIMIT .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: And , um , then {disfmarker} after {disfmarker} after , uh , um , doing TIMIT . Right ?\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Um , that 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that 's , um {disfmarker} that 's just the ph the phone recognition task .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad F: Uh , I wanted to take a look at , um , things that I could model within word . So , I would mov I would then shift the focus to , um , something like Schw - Switchboard , uh , where I 'd {disfmarker} I would be able to , um {disfmarker} to model , um , intermediate categories that span across phonemes ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: not just within the phonemes , themselves , um , and then do the same process there , um , on {disfmarker} on a large vocabulary task like Switchboard . Uh , and for thatto play with those filters , and {disfmarker} but while {pause} making this Wiener filter better . So . Yeah . That {disfmarker} that 's it , Morgan .\nProfessor B: Uh , last week you were also talking about building up the subspace {pause} stuff ?\nPhD G: Yeah . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I would actually m m didn't get enough time to work on the subspace last week . It was mostly about {pause} finding those bugs and\nProfessor B: OK .\nPhD G: th you know , things , and I didn't work much on that .\nPhD A: How about you , Carmen ?\nPhD D: Well , I am still working with , eh , VTS . And , one of the things that last week , eh , say here is that maybe the problem was with the diff because the signal have different level of energy .\nProfessor B: Hmm ?\nPhD D: And , maybe , talking with Stephane and with Sunil , we decide that maybe it was interesting to {disfmarker} to apply on - line normalization before applying VTS . But then {vocalsound} we decided that that 's {disfmarker} it doesn't work absolutely , because we modified also the noise . And {disfmarker} Well , thinking about that , we {disfmarker} we then {disfmarker} we decide that maybe is a good idea . We don't know . I don't hav I don't {disfmarker} this is {disfmarker} I didn't {pause} do the experiment yet {disfmarker} to apply VTS in cepstral domain .\nProfessor B: The other thing {pause} is {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} so , in {disfmarker} i i and {disfmarker} Not {disfmarker} and C - zero would be a different {disfmarker} So you could do a different normalization for C - zero than for other things anyway . I mean , the other thing I was gonna suggest is that you could have {pause} two kinds of normalization with {disfmarker} with , uh , different time constants . So , uh , you could do some normalization {vocalsound} s uh , before the VTS , and then do some other normalization after . I don't know . But {disfmarker} but C - zero certainly acts differently than the others do ,\nPhD D: Uh .\nProfessor B: so that 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: Well , we s decide to m to {disfmarker} to obtain the new expression if we work in the cepstral domain . And {disfmarker} Well . I am working in that now ,\nProfessor B: Uh - huh .\nPhD D: but {vocalsound} I 'm not sure if that will be usefu useful . I don't know . It 's k it 's k It 's quite a lot {disfmarker} It 's a lot of work .\nProfessor B: Uh - huh .\nPhD D: Well , it 's not too much , but this {disfmarker} it 's work .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: And I want to know if {disfmarker} if we have some {pause} feeling that {pause} the result {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I would like to know if {disfmarker} I don't have any feeling if this will work better than apply VTS aft in cepstral domain will work better than apply in m mel {disfmarker} in filter bank domain . I r I 'm not sure . I don't {disfmarker} I don't know absolutely nothing .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Well , you 're {disfmarker} I think you 're the first one here to work with VTS , so , uh , maybe we could call someone else up who has , ask them their opinion . Uh ,\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: I don't {disfmarker} I don't have a good feeling for it . Um .\nPhD G: Pratibha .\nPhD C: Actually , the VTS that you tested before was in the log domain and so {pause} the codebook is e e kind of dependent on the {pause} level of the speech signal .\nPhD D: Yeah ?\nPhD C: And {disfmarker} So I expect it {disfmarker} If {disfmarker} if you have something that 's independent of this , I expect it to {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} to , uh , be a better model of speech .\nPhD D: To have better {disfmarker}\nPhD C: And . Well .\nProfessor B: You {disfmarker} you wouldn't even need to switch to cepstra . Right ? I mean , you can just sort of normalize the {disfmarker}\nPhD C: No . We could normali norm I mean , remove the median .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Yeah . And then you have {pause} one number which is very dependent on the level cuz it is the level ,\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: and the other which isn't .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . Yeah . But here also we would have to be careful about removing the mean {pause} of speech and not of noise .\nPhD D: Ye\nPhD C: Because it 's like {pause} first doing general normalization\nPhD D: Yea\nPhD C: and then noise removal , which is {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Yeah . We {disfmarker} I was thinking to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to estimate the noise {pause} with the first frames and then apply the VAD ,\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: before the on - line normalization .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: We {disfmarker} we see {disfmarker} Well , I am thinking {vocalsound} about that and working about that ,\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: but I don't have result this week .\nProfessor B: Sure . I mean , one of the things we 've talked about {disfmarker} maybe it might be star time to start thinking about pretty soon , is as we look at the pros and cons of these different methods , how do they fit in with one another ? Because {pause} we 've talked about potentially doing some combination of a couple of them . Maybe {disfmarker} maybe pretty soon we 'll have some sense of what their {pause} characteristics are ,\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: so we can see what should be combined .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Is that it ? OK ?\nProfessor B: OK . Why don't we read some digits ?\nPhD A: Yep . Want to go ahead , Morgan ?\nProfessor B: Sure .\nPhD A: Transcript L dash two one five .\nProfessor B: O K .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did Grad F think about intermediate categories?\nAnswer:[/INST]
human: ['Grad F informed the team that he was building a system that classified intermediate categories with multi-band techniques. Then, to reduce error for phoneme recognition, the intermediate categories could be added to improve performance. The method could be replicated for large vocabulary tasks like switchboard.']
no:  According to the meeting transcript, Grad F is planning to write up a proposal and give it to people ahead of time, including intermediate categories, and then have a short presentation where people ask questions. Grad F is also thinking about building up subspace and finding bugs, but didn't get enough time to work on it last week.
hard: GradF thought of beginning by writing a proposed proposal and expectedto complete that effort, hopefully by the following Monday. They plannedto provide their full detailed plan for everybody to examine by the following Monday. They aimtodevelop a few initial features using multi-frequency techniques before assessingeact features to categorizes. They plannedto recognize each subsequent step they undertake and revist oradd new ones to lessens errors as muchas posible

no:  Certainly! Here's an expanded version of the sentence "It changed my life":\n\n"It changed my life" is a profound and transformative statement that can have a wide range of meanings and implications. For some, it may signify a momentous occasion that altered the course of their existence, such as the birth of a child, a wedding, or a major career milestone. For others, it may represent a more subtle but no less significant shift, like the discovery of a new hobby or passion, a move to a new home or city, or a personal realization that led to a deeper understanding of oneself.\nRegardless of the specific context, "it" in this sentence typically refers to a life-altering event or experience that had a lasting impact on the speaker's perspective, priorities, and overall well-being. This could involve a major life change, such as a divorce, a job loss, or a health crisis, or it could be something more subtle, like a gradual realization of one's values and goals, or a gradual shift in one's perspective on life.\nIn some cases, "it" may even refer to a traumatic or difficult experience that had a profound impact on the speaker's life, such as the loss of a loved one, a natural disaster, or a personal crisis.
