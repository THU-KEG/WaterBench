{"input": "( LI5 ) Explain to me the collapse of the Soviet Union . How did one of the largest superpowers manage to fall ? Is it possible something similar could eventually happen to the USA ? Explain like I'm five.", "context": "", "outputs": ["There 's actually a lot to it . There 's the collapse of the \" sattelites \" ( nations under the Soviet umbrella like East Germany , Poland or the Ukraine ) and of the Kremlin itself . Because the Soviets saw themselves as a global ideology , ie , workers everywhere will rise up and overthrow their capitalist masters , the fall and reversion of sattelites and communist allies weakened their image , which , coupled with crippling economic issues back home , lead to their collapse . Let 's break down the factors : 1 . * * External Issues * * : A : The US and its allies were doing everything they could to defy the \" spread of communism \" . This often meant funding local political competitors or even directly intervening ( Korea , Vietnam ) . This could mean anything from shipping arms to Greece , bribing politicians in Italy to team up ( which most people do n't know threatened to go communist ) , to even aligning themselves with former fascists ! As long as you were n't communist , you could be a total tyrant and we would support you against the Reds . The CIA even handed out orange scarves and signs in Ukraine because the opposition \" solidarity \" party had orange as its color ! B. China , once an ideological ally of the Soviets , broke away because they were afraid of Soviet influence . They had their own brand of \" communism \" that I wo n't get into because it could fill 10 threads but basically they broke what was a very intimidating alliance . C. Globalization ( and this is somewhat internal as well ) lead to a lot of discontent . This , coupled with what you 've probably heard called * perestroika * , which was actually an attempt by the Soviet Union to modernize itself and fix its ailing economy ( addressed later ) is often cited as THE # 1 reason for the fall of the Soviet Union . Basically , you get an open media ( glasnost ) that starts telling the truth about people disappearing and about the quality of life outside of the Soviet Union versus in it and this leads to a lot of people saying \" hey wait , the capitalist workers have it better ! \" 2 . * * Internal Issues * * A. No computers ! One thing it 's important to remember is that the Kremlin was the biggest , most convoluted , wasteful bureaucracy in the history of the world . It tried to set the prices for everything , rather than letting market demand handle that . This lead to a lot of crazy redundancies like it being cheaper to take a cab from Moscow to St. Petersburg than it would be to take a train or a plane . Imagine all the paperwork that would require ! Now imagine , on top of this huge bureaucracy , you have an entire nation like Poland , a huge chunk of land and industry , up and leave the Union . Imagine what it would be like to try to micromanage every tremor that would send through your market , * on paper * . Nearly impossible ! B. Corruption . You can imagine that in a country where there 's only 1 political party , any competitors are killed , declared insane , sent to itnernment camps , or some combination of those things , that this \" vanguard party \" is going to command a lot of power . And , as usual , power corrupts . Especially when you can control every single flow of goods and resources . The Soviet system actually ended up being incredibly unfair ! You can imagine that people did n't like that , and that it lead to a lot of waste . For all that , the Soviet Union did n't just explode one day . People call it a collapse because the Soviet Sattelites seemed to turn capitalist and leave the union in the blink of an eye ( because after one went , others were emboldened , and because the Soviet presence was weaker , so it was mostly local communist sympathizers with some Soviet support versus local nationalist / royalist / fascist / capitalist / christian sympathizers with the West 's support ) , but the Vanguard Party itself actually surrendered itself ( to the Russians ) very slowly via internal market reform and democratization . So to answer your last question , is it possible that the US could lose its satellites that we do n't have , and then become more fair and democratic , I would say \" I certainly hope so ! \" -edit Disclaimer : not that the Russians are super fair and democratic now .", "MA International Relations here .

{"input": "how do we diferentiate the frequency of a note from the sound that characterize a certain instirment ? Why can I tell an A on a cello apart from an A on a piano ? Please explain like I'm five.", "context": "", "outputs": ["Timbre . An A on either is not a single frequency , it is a \" fundamental \" and a bunch of multiples of that frequency , called \" overtones \" . Together they make up the timbre of that instrument . Different instruments have different overtones . Of course , they may also have other characteristics , such as the rate of attack ( how the volume grows from zero to full amplitude ) and decay ( the opposite ) .", "Two main things differentiate different sounds that have the same frequency . One is the \" shape \" of the sound . In nature , the shape of the frequency is likely to be a sine - wave . On a graph it would be a snake - like shape . Electronically generated sounds can have different shapes , like a square - wave , sawtooth - wave , or whatever . Second is the overtones . Suppose the frequency is middle C , at 262 beats per second . One instrument might have a strong overtone at the next C up , with a frequency of 524 beats per second . Another instrument might have hardly any sound there , but a strong overtone at the next C above that . We hear the lowest frequency as the note , and we hear the shape and the overtone as information about the kind of instrument that created that note .", "Three main things : * Timbre ( Which overtones - I 'll explain what those are soon - are most present in the sound ) * Envelope . This describes the amplitude shape of the sound - how hard is the attack , how long does the attack stay that way , how long does the sound last , and how quickly does the sound decay ? In a synthesizer , you can control all of these components through something called ADSR ( Attack - Decay - Sustain - Release ) . * Additional Noise ( The sound of the guitar amp hum , the squeak of a piano pedal , the rosin of the bow on the violin string , etc ) Now , Timbre . Notes are made of vibrations . Imagine a vibrating string . That string vibrates along its entire length , but it also vibrates along divisions of that length . The smaller the divisions , the higher the notes . This means that inside of every note you hear are several , fainter , higher notes . These are called partials , overtones , or harmonics . An instrument 's timbre is decided largely by the * balance * of those overtones . A flute , for example , has a very pure overtone expression with mostly lower , consonant ( meaning , for ELI5 purposes , \" pleasant \" ) partials . This gives it a clear sound . A distorted electric guitar , by contrast , has a lot of presence in its higher partials , which gives it more of a jagged quality . This is an over - simplified version , but all you need to know is that the overtone pattern determines much of the quality of the sound . You can actually hear the overtone series in your own voice , because each vowel brings out a different overtone . Sing a medium - low note in your range , clearly , and switch slowly between \" ooh \" and \" ee \" - you should hear , faintly , a note above the note you 're singing that suddenly gets higher and louder when you sing the \" ee \" . If you get good enough at this , you can do what [ this weird awesome lady ] ( URL_0 ) does and sing two notes at the same time . The same thing that makes two of your vowels sound different - even though they 're almost identical sounds coming from the same voice - is what makes two instruments sound different : overtones . But what happens if two instruments have similar overtone profiles ? A trumpet and an oboe , for example , have almost identical timbres . Here we want to look at our envelope , particularly our attack . A trumpet has a very crisp , biting attack that 's very fast , while an oboe has a much more mellow attack . If we jump into the middle of an oboe or trumpet note , it 's hard to hear the difference - but that initial attack & sputter in the trumpet makes the difference very clear ! The vocal equivalent of this would be consonants . Finally , noise . In addition to the overtone series and the envelope , there are all sorts of noises that go along with a sound that we may not consider as musical but are nonetheless important . The sound of additional air coming through a trumpet , the rattle in somebody 's voice when they sing a note too early in the morning , the buzz of a guitar amplifier . Our ear takes all of these clues , puts them together , and - voila ! - you 've perceived not just what the note is , but what kind of instrument is making the note !"], "input_length": 42, "output_length": 299.6666666666667, "length": 341.6666666666667, "all_classes": "null", "language": "en", "dataset": "longform_qa", "_id": "f9352a33010fb45adcef96c4f603f7aa15cfa3bd6b80fb70bea659d7c3334ea7"}

This is because of chemicals called hormones that your body makes to help you grow up . The book \" Catcher in the Rye \" is all about growing up . Its main character , also called a \" protagonist \" , is a teenage boy who is experiencing the full effect of hormones . As a result , he is angry at a lot of people , and sad with the way the world is . He runs away from home after being kicked out from his school for not doing well . After this , he travels around America and has some adventures , although most of these are not good adventures , but bad things that people should not do , like stealing and lying , and doing bad things with girls . He also says a lot of bad words . This has made some people think that the book is bad for people to read it , as it might teach them to do bad things , or use a lot of bad words . The main character also talks about a fantasy he has where he protects children from growing up . Some people think this is bad , as teenagers who are feeling the effects of hormones might be influenced to try not to grow up , rebelling against growing up as a person . Another thing that makes people talks a lot about the book is that the people who try to ban it to protect children from it are acting like the main character in his fantasy to protect children . One thing that has made people really be worried about people reading the book is the fact that it has influenced several people who have then tried to , or actually killed other people . One of these was John Lennon , a famous musician ; the man who shot him had the book with him when he did it , and called it his statement . Some people think the book made him do it , but other people think he was sick in the head and he just thought the book was influencing him .", "it 's a pretty tame book . It was \" banned \" and such before Lennon 's assassination .

I should note that these instances * really are n't that bad * . Holden does n't exactly munch clit or anything . He hires a prostitute and chickens out ( I think he tried to have a conversation with her instead ... her pimp punches him out ) . He flirts with some girls . There 's really not much more sexual content than that . I 'm thinking it was pretty much a shocking thing for mid - century readers for a book to be first - person narrated by an adolescent so * honestly * .

There 's also a lot of controversy regarding the merit of the novel . It 's probably the most hated of the \" classics \" . The main criticism is that Holden is unlikable and \" does n't do anything \" . I 'm of the opinion that that 's kinda the point . He is n't supposed to be an Indiana Jones or anything . It 's a coming - of - age novel , and one of the best . He starts out immature , and ends slightly less immature . People have the expectation that it 's going to be more like ...

Holden begins the story after being kicked out of Pencey Prep , an elite boarding school , as he is flunking his classes . He proceeds to go to New York City , ask a taxi driver about where ducks go , get rejected , try to pick up older women , get rejected , try to get a hooker , get rejected , until finally meeting with his sister Phoebe , pretty much the only person in the world he can talk to since his brother died of leukemia and his other brother became a sellout .

{"input": "How do physicists entangle particles in quantum entanglement ? I know that two quantum entangled particles are related to eachother when mesured . But how are these particles made ? Please explain like I'm five.", "context": "", "outputs": ["This is an excellent question and very hard to explain at an elementary school level . With that said , let 's start off by saying that two particles are considered entangled when their correlations satisfy Bell inequalities . This does n't answer how to explain it without knowing what correlations or bell inequalities are , but it 's the technical working definition . Picture two light particles separated by a very large distance , and measure their polarizations . If they 're so far apart that light could not have gone between the two of them in the time it took you to measure their polarization , AND their is a relationship between the two polarizations , then they are entangled . So we know how to tell if they 're entangled . So how do we actually entangle them ? One way is through quantum interference . In quantum mechanics , the \" state \" of a particle is represented by a \" wavefunction \" . Unlike an electric wave , there is nothing we know of that is actually waving . It does tell you the probability of measuring a particle or particle properties , though . Since it 's a wave , however , it posses wave properties like interference . If a crest and trough line up , the wave amplitude goes to zero at that point . One experiment where they tested this was the \" Hong - Ou - Mandel \" experiment . They sent two identical photons in two sides of a \" beamsplitter \" ( a device which splits light 50:50 ) and measured how often the two photons came out different sides or the same side . It turns out that the path for photons to come out different sides ( since there 's two ways for that to happen ) cancel out , and you only ever see two come out either side . The final state of the system is entangled : the two possible output states are in an equal \" superposition \" . There are other ways of entangling particles , though . Another commonly cited entanglement phenomena is in positronium ( an electron and its antiparticle orbiting each other ) . When the electron and positron ( anti - electron ) annihilate they have a certain probability to emit two photons in opposite directions with unknown but correlated polarizations . That is , when you measure the two photons they will always have polarizations at 90 degrees to each other no matter how far apart they are .", "The simplest example I can think of is by creating two particles that are entangled when they are made . If you 're not familiar with spin , it 's a number that is a measure of angular momentum . You can think of it as just an intrinsic property of particles without actually worrying about what it means . You take a particle(s ) with spin of 0 , then turn it into two particles having spin of , say , 1 . An example might be electron - positron annihilation . If the electron has a spin of +1/2 and the positron has a spin of -1/2 , the total spin of the system is 0 . When they run into each each other they will make two photons . Each photon must have spin of +1 or -1 . There 's a law that says that the total spin of a system must be conserved , the same way energy is conserved . Because the spins have to be 0 , this forces one of the photons to be +1 and the other to be -1 , they ca n't both have the same spin . The thing is , the quantum nature of the photons mean we do n't know which one is which , furthermore , they do n't have a well defined spin until something actually measures it . Say we go in and measure one of the photons . It could be either spin , but let 's say when we measure it as +1 , this forces the second particle to be of spin -1 . If we had measured the first as -1 , the second would be +1 . The key is that neither of these particles had a well defined spin until the moment it was measured , at which point it forced the other to be the opposite direction .", "From what I know there are many different ways to entangle \" particles\"(You got ta be carefull with that term since quantum objects can be seen as wave and particle ) . One possibility to entangle photons is per example the so called ' Spontaneous parametric down - conversion ' , where photons pass through a ( nonlinear ) crystal and have a chance to become two entangled photons with opposite polarisation . Another possibility is one or more objects that emmit two new objects , which are entangled . This can be an p.e . a molecule which gets \" destroyed \" into two atoms which are entangled or a particle and a anti - particle which ' destroy ' each other and emmit two photons .

{"input": "Why did the Nazis use heavy water ( deuterium oxide ) in an attempt to invent atomic weapons ? In the process , what is heavy water used for ? Why is it necessary , and why were they so interested in it ? Please explain like I'm five.", "context": "", "outputs": ["It makes it easier to sustain a chain reaction using normal fuel . Its a neutron moderator , you can use it in heavy water based reactors ( that do not require enriched uranium ) such as the Canadian CANDU . Heavy water moderated reactors running on unenriched uranium could eventually produce enough plutonium for a bomb . You could have used Graphite instead , i think .", "First , they were trying to build a nuclear reactor , not a nuclear bomb . Even those who think they were trying to build a bomb acknowledge this \u2014 it is because building large reactors is one of the paths to creating the fuel for a bomb . In a nuclear reactor , you are trying to get uranium-235 atoms to absorb neutrons so that they split , releasing more neutrons . The fuel for a reactor , however , has very little U-235 in it . Unenriched fuel , which is what everyone during WWII was using , has less than 1 % U-235 in it . The rest of the fuel is U-238 , which will not fission easily . So the odds of an individual neutron hitting a U-235 atom are low , and the odds that the neutrons produced by the subsequent fission reaction will find another U-235 atom are also low . This is why you can put as much unenriched uranium in one place as you want and normally nothing will happen . To increase the odds , there are two things you can do . One is to increase the relative quantity of U-235 in the fuel \u2014 enrichment . This is how a bomb works , and many reactors today also work this way ( standard civilian power reactor fuel is enriched to 3 - 4 % U-235 , a nuclear bomb is 80 - 90 % U-235 ) . The other is to add what is known as a \" moderator . \" A moderator is a light element that the neutrons created by fission reactions can bounce off of . This bouncing decreases their energy / speed / temperature ( all the same thing at this scale ) . Low - energy neutrons have a higher likelihood of getting absorbed by U-235 atoms than higher - energy neutrons . The reason has to do with the fact that at those sizes , the relationship between the speed of a particle and the size of a particle are inverse ; from the neutron 's perspective , the U-235 atoms get bigger when it slows down . More or less . So if you take unenriched uranium and intersperse it with a good moderator , the atoms from fission will get slowed down , and that increases the chance they 'll find and hit another U-235 atom , and the reaction will continue . The two candidates for moderators that were explored during World War II were graphite ( basically just carbon atoms ) and heavy water . ( Regular water can worked with slightly enriched uranium , but not unenriched uranium ; there are obscure nuclear physics reasons for this . ) In the US , they used graphite . At first they found that graphite did n't work that well . They discovered that this was n't a problem with graphite , per se , but because the methods of producing graphite introduced impurities like boron , which is a neutron absorber . So they worked with the graphite producers to make extremely pure graphite , which worked very well . The US also built several heavy water plants , in case the graphite did n't work out . They did produce a heavy water reactor ( CP-3 ) that went online in 1944 , but their main reactors used graphite . In Germany , they explored graphite but also found it did n't work well . They did n't realize this was because of impurities . So they pursued only the heavy water route , because they had heavy water production facilities under their control . However , they never acquired enough heavy water to actually make a nuclear reactor ( and this is unrelated to the sabotage of the heavy water plant by the Allies , as an aside ) , and even if they had acquired enough , it would have , at most , allowed them to make a small , experimental nuclear reactor , not generate enough plutonium to make a nuclear bomb . The notion that the Germans were close to getting a bomb is a complete myth \u2014 they were very far from it by the end of the war . So , to conclude : heavy water was chosen as a moderator for the German reactor experiments . [ Here is a graphic ] ( URL_0 ) which compares US and German heavy water stockpiles , and even if is a little misleading because a lot of the German heavy water was diluted . CP-3 is shown to give you an idea of how much heavy water you need for a small nuclear reactor . To make a bomb , you need much larger reactors than that .", "Their original plan was not to build an atomic weapon , but an nuclear reactor .

I ca n't give you an exact reason because I think there are multiple reasons it is or hit or miss .

I believe that Ambian is better absorbed in the small intestine . ( This is why giving it with food would be a bad idea as that means your stomach is going to hold on to the food until it is broken down and then it will begin to be released to the small intestine . So the drug is just sitting there in your stomach instead of being absorbed . ) Right , so the reason I think Ambian is absorbed in the small intestine is because if you look at the drug name , it 's called zolpidem tartrate . Again , not certain , but I believe the purpose of the tartrate is to \" soak - up \" protons so that the environment is a little more basic , Leaving the drug in its uncharged form , which is the form it needs to be in order to be absorbed . So , if you are like me , and have constant heartburn anyway , it seems to help with absorption . Also , the antacid I linked has famotidine in it . There is an analogue of this drug called cimetidine , which is known to have drug interactions in the liver . For Ambian , there is some evidence of a slight interaction with cimetidine although I ca n't find the paper right now . If I remember correctly , this just means that your liver would take longer to break down Ambian , thereby prolonging it 's effect . Which would n't be so great if you had to be up early . Normally , Ambian clears from your system rather quickly . This is n't medical advice . This is just what I do and why I do it . Hope it helps ."], "input_length": 52, "output_length": 293.6666666666667, "length": 345.6666666666667, "all_classes": "null", "language": "en", "dataset": "longform_qa", "_id": "2b1dbdd1afb6384d82844c52fa2340a056eba8f867905b4ae949cc5054b121b9"}

Explain like I'm five.", "context": "", "outputs": ["Suppose you wanted to draw a solid square on paper but you only have rubber stamps of circles . How do you do draw a square ? You can use the biggest circle stamp , call it \" size 10 \" , to make one big circle , then stamp a smaller \" size 5 \" circle four times around the big circle , then use progressively smaller circle stamps to fill in the gaps until you have a solid square . As you can imagine you 'd be using the smallest circle stamp ( \" size 1 \" ) a lot to fill in the small white spaces at the sharp corners of the square . Now suppose you needed a shorthand notation to describe this to another stamp artist how you drew a square using only circle stamps : 1 square = 1 size10 + 4 size5 + 16 size3 + 86 size2 + 158 size1 Why is this useful ? In the world of electronics and signals it 's almost as if you 're trying to communicate information using only one type of rubber stamp : the sine wave . The Fourier Series allows you to express and communicate arbitrary information using the the rubber circle stamp of the electronics world : the sine wave . Added bonus , once information is translated into a sum of sine waves it can be transmitted , stored , and processed very easily . In fact you can use this for compression . Suppose you do n't need to draw a perfect square , an approximate square would be good enough . Then you can transmit less information : 1 square = 1 size10 + 4 size5 + 16 size3 It 's a lumpy square but good enough . This is basis for JPEG and MPG signal compression : it translates the data into a wave , expresses that wave an approximate sum of sine waves , some of the fine detail information is lost , the information about how to reconstruct the signal is what is stored and transmitted , but overall our eyes and ears do n't notice that fine detail that was lost .", "This may be LI4 , but : Say you want to make 11 , but you only have a 4s and 1s . You would take two 4s and three 1s and add them together , right . Now say you have a crazy function ( curvy line on a graph ) , that 's your \" 11 \" . It turns out that you can take a bunch of sine and cosine functions ( these are your 4s and 1s ) , and add them together just like we did with the 4s and 1s to get your curvy line . A little more complex : constructing a given function ( your curvy line ) takes a precise combination of the right sine and cosine functions . And just like we took * * two * * 4s and * * three * * 1s , we add those sines and cosines with different * weights * or * coefficients * . Say the given function is more like sin(x ) than cos(x ) , we will add a large sin(x ) to a small cos(x ) .", "LI12 Version : A Fourier Series is a way to break down a periodic shape as a sum of more basic components . Think of some random periodic function as a cookie . It 's really made up of ingredients like flour , butter , sugar , etc . You could write an equation like cookies = # cups x flour + # tbsps x butter + # cups x sugar + ..... for all the ingredients . For any periodic ( endlessly repeating ) function , we can break it up into the most bare bones periodic functions , which are sines and cosines . These look just like waves in a pool or on a string . The equation looks like COMPLEX SHAPE = # x cosine ( # ) + # x sine ( # ) + # x cosine(2 x # ) + ..... The # just stands for some number that is n't important . The important part is that by adding together these very simple functions ( cosine and sine are the simplest possible periodic functions ) , any function can be recreated . The more terms that are used , the better the approximation . In the same fashion of decomposing into fundamental building blocks , a fourier transform takes some complex signal and rewrites it in terms of the frequencies that make it up . Take a complex musical note for example . If you play a chord on a guitar , all you hear is the signal sound generated . But that sound is made up of a number of different strings playing notes at different frequencies all melding together . A transform allows you to go back and forth between thinking about the note as a single complex note or as a number of very simple ones at different frequencies ."], "input_length": 37, "output_length": 292.3333333333333, "length": 329.3333333333333, "all_classes": "null", "language": "en", "dataset": "longform_qa", "_id": "ee32dba27e435d9372bd00b4fe32f5de5726f45c0ff6d7e4e5d9bb0e03912c64"}

The fact that you are asking why the American cops are brutalizing shows just how much the media has influenced you into thinking it is a pandemic thing .", "During the wild sixties and seventies and drug fueled eighties . Police encountered alot of defiance and violence . They adapted their techniques in dealing with the public that minimized their personal space . Over time the perceived threat of police brutality from the communities has evolved into stronger defiance and violence against the police which results in almost military engagement amongst police which many of them are not completely ready for . The police have protocols but many go extreme because of their training combined with adrenaline , fear , defensive instinct and revenge", "I would say that it is pandemic as opposed to being epidemic , that is , it is n't just happening in NYC or Ferguson or Chicago . While the vast majority of police officers in every department are not guilty of brutality or even of looking the other way , it is , and has been , happening in isolated cases across the country . Further , it also seems to be indicative of police deference and entitlement . Little things like officers not following departmental protocols time and time again after reported incidents of the use of extreme force ( e.g. not getting / recording post - incident interviews , failing to collect evidence ) without action taken by the chief or a political system have led to people simply losing faith in the police . Many feel that the entitlement is so rampant that the officers ca n't be trusted as they once were . It goes deeper than this too . There is a very real and deeply seated distrust between non - whites ( and sympathetic / empathetic whites ) and the justice system . Exacerbated by a failed war on drugs and the still tender wounds of the civil rights movement . ( That 's my explanation of the Police side of the issue but , like everything , there are two sides here ) As mentioned above , ours is a generation born of several decades of political strife , or at least our privileged \" first world problems \" version of it . From Vietnam and the Civil Rights movement to Rodney King and Katrina , you could say that protest and civil disobedience is in our blood . This has led to a public refusal to capitulate to authority and , for many , the automatic assumption that those with power are disinterested in the common good or even actively opressive . Law enforcement agencies , as a result , feel they are now in an arms race of sorts . Additional firepower and more agressive tactics have been , they feel , necessitated by a progressively more uncooperative ( and often better armed ) public . This in turn reenforces the public 's notions of opression . ( That is my ELI5 of the situation , the rest is my personal opinion on it ) You will hear often ( in fact a couple comments here reference it ) that these incidents are so infrequent that they hardly deserve attention , the current furor being nothing more than the direct result of news media sensationalization . Worse , you will hear people arguing that Police are people too , they make mistakes and we have to be able to forgive and forget . These ideas are ignorant and ineffectual at best and dishonest and dangerous at worst . We hold our police officers up to be the beacons of justice in this country . Undoubtedly it is a high standard perhaps unachievable but law enforcement is the tool through which we shape a better more idealized society . I firmly believe that we are only ever as righteous as the least righteous amongst us . Police departments have a responsibility to weed out the offending officers . Instead they too often close ranks , look the other way or simply ignore the issue . There is an unfair level of distrust from the public but unfortunately that is not going to change over night . We are many and old grudges die hard , even ill - informed ones . If , however , Law Enforcement decides to take it upon themselves to address the public 's concerns we could arrive at a better level of safety and mutual respect within a couple decades at most . Yes it means being the bigger \" person \" but is n't that exactly what we should expect from our police departments ?

Can anyone explain it like I 'm 5 ? Please explain like I'm five.", "context": "", "outputs": ["Not really ELI5 - able because it 's a complicated subject but : So , whenever you sell property ( subject to an insane number of rules ) you calculated the amount that you gained or lost on your investment , and if you had a gain ( called a \" capital gain \" ) they you pay taxes on that gain . As an example : you buy $ 10,000 worth of stock , then sell it a year later for $ 30,000 ( good investment ) and pay taxes on your $ 20,000 ( $ 30,000 - $ 10,000 ) profit . Now , for inherited items , this gets a little tricky . So instead of you buying that stock , lets say your grandfather bought it at $ 10,000 and when he died it was worth $ 25,000 , and when you finally sold it you got $ 30,000 for it . Under the current tax plan , you 're only required to pay taxes on a gain of $ 5,000 , because you 're allowed to use the value at the time of inheritance as your \" basis \" in the stock ( \" basis \" is the technical term for basically \" the value you calculate your gain / loss from \" ) . * * Under the new plan :* * you would instead pay taxes on the $ 20,000 gain , using the original $ 10,000 basis from the original purchase of the stock ( with exemptions of something like $ 250,000 per person , to spare the middle class ) . Also , note that capital gains have generally been taxed at a lower percentage than ordinary income ( currently 15 % for anyone in the 25 % income tax bracket or up ) , with the rationale being basically that this will encourage business investment . Of course , since many very rich people make the vast majority of their income in the form of capital gains and not salary , it also causes the famous case of billionaires paying lower tax rates than their secretaries ( see : Buffett , Warren ) . In a related proposal , Obama has suggest raising the capital gains rate to 28 % for couples with incomes in excess of $ 500,000 . Those two changes would result in the government raising a lot of extra revenue ( as well as long - term macroeconomic consequences that I am not qualified to speculate on ) . Source : I prepared taxes professionally for five years", "Let 's say you buy stock at $ 10 . You hold it for 20 years , and now it 's worth $ 100 . Normally , when you sell that asset , you pay capital gains taxes on the $ 90 difference in price . Now , you put that stock into a trust and you drop dead before selling it . Your children crack the trust at the $ 100 level . When they sell it , they do n't pay the capital gains tax on the $ 90 profit , as they obtained it at the $ 100 level . Thus , all that income generated from the stock is never taxed at all . As a result , there 's $ 90 per share worth of taxes [ or , more accurately , 20 years of capital gains taxes ] just getting lost .", "When you buy capital assets ( think of things like stocks ) , you have what is called a \" basis \" in that asset . Your basis is usually , with some exceptions , what you paid to purchase the asset . So for example , if you bought a share of stock for $ 100 , your basis in that share of stock is $ 100 . When you sell the stock later , if it is worth more than it was when you bought it , you have \" capital gain . \" The capital gain is the increase in value between your basis and the amount you sold it for . So in this example , lets say that 5 years later , the stock is worth $ 150 . When you sell this stock , you have $ 50 of capital gain . Here is the part that Obama calls the \" Trust Fund Loophole . \" When a person dies , then can give their capital assets to a relative . When they do this , the basis in the assets given is automatically changed to same value as the current value of the asset . So in our example , if the person did n't sell the stock , and instead gave it to their daughter when they died , the daughter now owns the stock and the basis is $ 150 . This is important because it allows the daughter to sell the stock immediately , and pay no capital gains taxes . Had the father sold it before he died , he would have paid capital gains taxes on the $ 50 of capital gains ."], "input_length": 46, "output_length": 288.6666666666667, "length": 334.6666666666667, "all_classes": "null", "language": "en", "dataset": "longform_qa", "_id": "2a7b4c5aca63bcec99f89f03eac283cb064ffbb75793f787ccf61a78bd0b8886"}

How do officers get necessary information like specific addresses or assigned to calls ? US resident Please explain like I'm five.", "context": "", "outputs": ["Dispatcher here . I dispatch for a sheriffs office in a ski county . Our dispatch center dispatches for the county deputies , the state troopers , the park rangers , the wildlife officers , the US forest service officers , and local fire and EMS . As far dispatching law enforcement goes , each agency has a certain jurisdiction , and if a call happens in their jurisdiction we usually send one ( or multiple ) units depending on the call . For example the state troopers take all of the calls on the state roads and interstates ( accidents , traffic violations , road hazards , suspicious vehicles on the interstate , etc ) . The county deputies take all of the calls on county roads , and county property . These calls may include domestic violence calls at a citizens houses , burglary alarms , citizen complains against each other , welfare checks , and civil problems . They also patrol the area proactively trying to prevent crime . They have a job very similar to a city police officer . The park rangers take care of all of the problems in state park jurisdiction , and the wildlife officers generally ride around on ATVS and look for poachers , and take care of the wildlife people encounter on their property . The US forest officer takes the calls in the national forest in our jurisdiction and patrols the highway the passes through it . He may also receive help from our deputies if need be because we have a deputy whose zone passes through his national forest . We also have a local police department in the area , but their dispatch is in another location and we occasionally coordinate . We can hear each others radio traffic , but do n't dispatch each others officers . Now , there are about 6 troopers ( Highway patrol ) on air in the busiest time , and they are separated into 3 zones . Each trooper is assigned a zone , and if we receive a call in their zone we generally ask them to respond . If all the troopers in their zone are unavailable , we ask the officer in charge to advise . The deputies have 4 zones with 6 deputies on duty . 4 deputies have their own zone ( so one in each zone ) and there is a float who will respond to any call if an officer is busy , and another call comes in in their zone . There is also a SGT on duty who is the boss of the crew . If a call comes in their zone , they are dispatched to it , and if deputies from another zone come to assist , the officer who is assigned to that zone will be in charge of the call ( write the big report , and if needed , take the prisoner into the jail ) . When we take a call our system automatically recognizes the address and maps it for us , and we can see whose zone it is in , and we send that unit . Generally , there is a unit available to assist if they need backup , and all officers in every agency will back each other if they feel they are in a dangerous situation . We have a computer aided dispatch system that tracks all of the calls , and what every unit is doing , so we know if they are available , unavailable , their location and how long they have been on that call so we can security check them if need be . I 'm not going into detail with any other agency besides the highway patrol and Sherrifs deputies because they all pretty much have one zone . I hope this covers at least a small chunk of curiosity . Feel free to ask more questions , because I 'm sure I 've probably made no sense . Oh , and they know the address because it shows up on their mobile dispatch center on their computer in their vehicle , and we always tell them when we dispatch them on the call .", "Depends on the size of the department .

{"input": "How does city zoning work in London ? For example , Camden is a borough in the city of Westminster which itself is in the city of London . How is it that a city exists within a city ? Please explain like I'm five.", "context": "", "outputs": ["Lifelong Londoner here . I 'll try to explain . First , you have one outright mistake in your question , and a couple of points of confusion . The outright mistake is this : \" Camden is a borough in the city of Westminster \" . No , it is n't . So let 's try to clarify . \" Greater London \" is a geographic and political entity . It 's approximately 600 square miles in size and has a population of around 8.5 million people . Certain functions , such as transport and many development and economic issues , are considered important enough that there is an elected mayor for the whole of Greater London ( known , unsurprisingly , as the Mayor of London , but we 'll come back to this ) , and an elected body , the Greater London Assembly , which between them set policies . The Mayor and GLA also provide the budget for the police and fire service in London , and have a say in their running . To provide more local representation and deal with less London - wide issues , Greater London is then subdivided into 33 boroughs . One of these boroughs is the London Borough of Camden , another is the London Borough of the City of Westminster ( we 'll come to the reason for it having \" city \" in its name later ) . But Camden and Westminster are completely separate entities ; apart from the fact that they 're both one of the 33 boroughs they have nothing else in common . Most of the boroughs have an official name of \" The London Borough of * whatever * \" but a couple are called \" The City of * whatever * \" . This is because the history of human settlement in the London area dates way , way , back , long before the establishment of Greater London . For example the city of Westminster grew up from about the 10th century , so as the area that was later called London grew it was eventually swallowed up . The borough retains the name of what was once a separate , independent city , however . And then there 's the borough called \" The City of London \" . This one is special in many ways . The City of London ( the word \" City \" is * * always * * spelt with a capital in this context ) is tiny . It 's only about one square mile in size . It 's essentially the area that once sat within the old Roman walls of their city of * Londinium * , and today it 's completely dominated by being the headquarters of many financial companies -- so much so that in the UK simply saying \" The City \" is a shorthand way of saying \" financial services companies \" , just as in the US saying \" Wall Street \" has the same connotation . Despite being a borough of Greater London , the City of London has many special privileges and rights , which have been laid down over about a thousand years worth of legislation . In particular it elects its own mayor , known as \" The Lord Mayor of London \" although this is now a ceremonial position rather than one with any specific power . The City has its own separate police force from the rest of Greater London , has many of its own laws , and ( somewhat controversially ) positions on the City of London council are voted for by the corporations that are based in the City , rather than the ( very few ) people who live there , as happens in every other UK election .", "> How is it that a city exists within a city ? but to be honest , what does it change ? we have countries ( Vatican ) withing countries ( Italy ) , so city ( City of London ) within the city ( London / Greater London ) is not problematic at all . > But trapping nations is not just Italy 's thing for there 's also Lesotho , in South Africa which is both the largest encircled country at 70 times Vatican City 's size and the most populated with over 2,000,000 citizens . from [ CGPGrey bizarre borders ] ( URL_0 )", "This gets * very * confusing and I do n't have time to go into it all right now .

Well the top Police Officer in Britain and his no.2 have both had to step down . There are many more but you get the point - the corruption has landed many higher ups in hot water .

{"input": "What gives atoms their various properties ? Glancing at the period table I can discern no pattern . Can you predict what behaviour an atom will have because of the balance of subatomic particles in the system ? Please explain like I'm five.", "context": "", "outputs": ["Yes , broadly speaking . Atoms gain their properties due to their valence . Learning about this is basically most of the first semester of a college chemistry course , but the short version is : Atoms are basically clouds of electrons surrounding a core of protons and neutrons . The clouds of electrons behave in a way that is random , but overall very predictable , and they try to form a pattern that resembles a shell of electrons composed of sets of four pairs to make an octet . Bigger atoms have many shells of eight , smaller ones may have only one ( or fewer than one complete shell ) but it 's only the outermost shell that really matters for bonding and chemical properties . When two elements bond , they share an electron or two to fulfil their octets . Different atoms as you go down a row of the periodic table have different numbers of valience electrons in their outermost shell . These are what make atoms react differently . Lithium , sodium , potassium , etc , have one atom in their outermost valience shell - that means they want to bond very much with something that can fill their shell . If you put sodium in water , it rips the water apart , and causes an explosion as the oxygen and hydrogen heat up . Likewise , flourine , chlorine , iodine , etc , all have seven electrons in their outer shell - they want badly to fill with things with only one electron , like hydrogen . That 's why these elements can make such powerful acids - it 's very easy for them to steal a hydrogen from water . Carbon has four electons . It ( and silicon , to a lesser degree ) is the whore of the elemnts . It loves to bond with a lot of stuff becuase there 's so many ways it can make pairs . Oxygen has six , so it loves to double bond ( share two pairs of electrons ) with carbon , or one each with hydrogen ( to make water . ) Finally the nobel gasses come complete with eight already . That 's why they hardly ever bond with * anything * . There 's more to this explanation than just that - radioactivity , transition elements , metals , different levels of valence shells , different types of bonds , subatomic forces , resonance , etc , but that is basically an entire chem course worth of information . But valence electrons are the most important thing overall .", "The periodic table is full of patterns . The ' magic numbers ' of chemistry are * 2 * 2 + 6 = 8 * 2 + 6 + 10 = 18 * 2 + 6 + 10 + 16 = 36 * 2 + 6 + 10 + 16 + 18 + 18 = 54 * 2 + 6 + 10 + 16 + 18 + 18 + 18 = 86 Electrons travel in ' shells ' and it takes 2 to fill the first shell , 6 to fill the second , 10 to fill the third , 16 to fill the fourth , and 18 to fill shells the fifth / sixth / seventh shells . Atoms strongly ' like ' to have perfectly filled shells . If need be , they 'll share , give , or take electrons from other atoms to get perfectly filled shells . ----- The rightmost column made of Noble Gases . They already have perfect shells . For the most part , Noble Gas atoms do n't react with other atoms . The left - most column is alkali metals . They have perfect shells plus one extra electron . They readily give away this extra electron to drop down to having perfect shells . Atoms in the left column tend to go ' boom ' in water . ( Look up sodium and water videos on YouTube . ) Carbon is part of column 14 . At 6 , carbon is 4 away from the magic number in the right hand column . Carbon needs a whopping 4 electrons to get to shell perfection , and makes all sorts of electron swaps to get there . Since carbon can make four electron swaps , it can make a huge number of compounds and is one of the key ingredients in the complex chemicals that make life possible .

And while we 're at it , clock speed is not a very good indicator of the actual performance of a CPU . There are lots of factors . the clock speed tells us the rate at which electrons travel through the circuit and settle down . It 's called a machine cycle . CPUs have an instruction set , that is a set of basic operations that they can perform . Each operation takes a certain number of machine cycles to complete . These operations are things like \" add , \" \" multiply , \" \" logical and , \" or \" memory read . \" There 's also something called pipelining , which allows multiple instructions to take place at the same time , but then you have to be careful about dependence on other instructions ! ( if instruction A adds two numbers and instruction B adds the result to a 3rd number , B has to wait for A ! but if A adds two numbers and B adds two different numbers , they may be able to run simultaneously . Good pipelining / optimization can detect this ) So pipelining and optimization is important . Many instructions , particularly memory reads , which are extremely important , and a good portion of what a program is doing at any given time , take several machine cycles to execute . And memory reads are really common . So the speed of communication between CPU and memory is really important , because if memory reads take fewer machine cycles , whole programs will run faster . There 's also special memory that exists on the CPU chip , called registers . The size and number of registers are also extremely important . But even above all that , the program that 's running and the way that it 's optimized for the CPU will probably have the most impact of all on performance . Also important , and increasingly so , is parallelization , which is where we tie in GPUs . A CPU runs one instruction after another ( with some pipelining , but it 's limited how much you can do at once with pipelining , you still need instructions to happen in order ) . Nowadays there are multiple cores , that means that there are two or more CPUs that can be executing their own instructions in sequence . You can do two or more things at once . This requires a more complex branch of programming called \" parallel programming \" to take full advantage of . ( CPUs can also have threads , which basically means that one CPU runs two lists of instructions by rapidly interleaving them ) . GPUs are the ultimate parallel processors . Unlike a CPU , a GPU does n't rely on rapidly executing a list of instructions in order , instead it executes a LOT of instructions simultaneously . Potentially thousands at once . This means that the things they are suited for are different . While a CPU is good for sequential ( serial ) operations where later instructions are dependent on the results of earlier instructions , GPUs are suited for problems where there is n't a lot of dependence . Like graphics . If you want to rapidly update every pixel on screen within 1/60th of a second , or do a bunch of matrix computations for 3D gaming ( did you see the top post on /r / askscience about linear algebra today ? ) , you do n't want a CPU to do millions of sequential operations . You want a GPU to do a couple massively parallel operations . That 's a high level description of the difference", "A CPU is like a guy running a parkour race , he can go as fast as he wants , he can make decisions , take shortcuts , but there is only one of him . So in an hour , he could have moved one person 5 miles . Even if you have multiple CPUs , they can each take their own route . A GPU is like a marching band in a parade . They all have to move in the same direction at the same time , only as fast as the slowest member , and coordinating to keep together . the route has to be planned out , and closed to other traffic , However if there were 100 band members , even if they only go 1 mile in an hour , they have moved 20 times as much as the single runner .", "CPUs and GPUs work a little differently .

Let 's invent two races . We 'll call then : Blues and Greens . Now , let 's try and define these races * biologically . * Ok , seems easy , right ? Blues are the ones that are blue , and greens are the ones that are green . Now let 's ask ourselves , can these races differ , mentally ? Yes and no . Yes , it may be possible that Blues , statistically , succeed better than Greens based on some sort of test . But also no , because the results of that test , and any statistical difference mentally , * has nothing to do with their race * . After all , we defined their race * only * by their color . Any apparent statistical differences between them in other ways are * * purely coincidental . * * For example , if there was some law that required that Greens were to be lobotomized at birth , then it may be technically true that Greens do not perform as well as Blues on mental tests . But , again , that has nothing to do with the fact that they are Green ( biologically ) . If you altered the circumstances that resulted in the poor performance of Greens , then it 's very well possible they would be on par , or even better than Blues on intelligence , while still being Green . So while we could acknowledge the difference , it would be inaccurate and inappropriate to attribute the difference as some secondary quality of our defined race . What happens if we change our definition , then ? Instead of simply saying that Blues are blue and Greens are green , we 'll say that Blues are a combination of physical and mental traits that are commonly associated with Blues and likewise for Green . This really does n't solve anything and in fact makes it worse . If you incorporate the apparent mental advantages of Blues into the definition of the Blue race , then you 're basically begging the question ; yeah Blues are better , mentally , because you 've defined them to be so . More importantly , since the mental differences are statistical , what do you do when you come across a lower than average Blue , or a greater than average Green ? Since you made the mental ability a defining trait , then technically a dumb Blue * is n't * a Blue nor is a smart Green a Green . It just complicates the issue without resolving anything .

So , as a consequence , the average quantity and quality of education among minorities is generally less than that of whites . So * of course * tests of mental abilities will result in minorities performing statistically worse than whites , * but that has nothing to do with their race . * So if you walk away from that study concluding that minorities are less intelligent than whites , then you 're ignoring the issue of * why * they performed poorly and , therefore , are precluding efforts to try and remedy what is most likely a problem . After all , we can at least recognize poverty and lack of education as a problem that is theoretically fixable .

This has NOTHING to do with the noise , everything to do with the stability of your neck . When you want to \" crack \" you neck , you are actually feeling a sense of limitation of motion in a part of your neck . When you \" crack \" it , you are actually forcing some part of the neck to over - compensate and become hyper - flexible . This hyper - flexibility stretches some of the joints between vertebrae ( and there are several that it could be ) , and this stretching causes bubble to form , they were n't always present as some redditors suggest . The bubble formation is in line with physic 's gas laws ( notably P1V1 = P2V2 ) that say when the volume of a joint space increase , the pressure inside the joint decreases . Decreased pressure ( especially in a rapid format ) causes gases that are otherwise dissolved in your fluids ( N2 , O2 , CO2 ) to form little bubbles , much like opening a soda forms bubbles . The formation of a bubble makes a noise , and that noise is a popping sound . It is also amplified greatly in your neck because this happens so close to your ears . These bubbles eventually dissolve back into the fluids of your body , which is why you ca n't crack your knuckles several times in a row . If you can crack a joint several times in a row , it is likely not a bubble formation ( called a cavitation ) . To the long term effects ... \" cracking \" your spine alone will not cause an issue . However , both the immobility of some segments that cause the feeling of needing to crack and the hypermobility of the habit of cracking do create structural instabilities in how your spine supports your body , moves and even the function of the nerves that radiate from the spine . \" Cracking \" does NOT FIX ANY PROBLEMS , as some people may suggest . We know this because the sensation of needing to crack does not go away . These long - term instability do create problems , including arthritis , nerve irritation , ligament instabilities and many secondary symptoms as a result of these conditions ( muscle spasms , headaches , abnormal sensations like burning , the list goes on ... ) To address a relevant misconception , a chiropractor ( specifically , a type of chiropractor who performs what is called Structural Chiropractic ) uses analytical methods to identify the regions of the spine responsible for the sensation of needing to crack the spine and corrects those specific regions . With some repeat adjustments and a good doctor , these regions can stabilize , causing the feeling to resolve completely . This comment opens so many doors , but here 's the TL;DR Cracking your neck is forcing a temporary hyper - mobility of the spine to compensate for instability in the spine in some other region . Cracking it does not correct the instability , hence the return of the sensation . Source : I 'm a Structural Chiropractor .", "The explanations of cracking given on this thread are wrong , its is cavitation bubbles . As you manipulate your joints you cause pressure changes in the fluids around your joints . The drop in pressure at certain areas causes voids to form , there are some gases in these bubbles , but compared to the pressure in the surrounding liquids , there may as well not be any , and can be treated as vacuums for the moment . These bubbles then pop as the fluid rushes back in . The small amount of gas inside then becomes over pressurized from the inward momentum of the fluid , and the now tiny bubble 's gasses get forced out violently resulting in a small sonic boom , the crack , and also interestingly sometimes light from the extreme temperatures the pressure brings ( up to several thousand kelvin in certain cavitations ) I do n't know if this applies in our joints though . Also as a note there have been no studies supporting that it causes damage , there was a man who won a joke Nobel , an Ig Nobel Prize , for cracking one hand 's knuckles for 60 years but not the other .

Autofocus is n't good enough because it does n't always know which thing should be in focus , and if it gets confused it may make the whole picture go blurry and useless for a bit which ruins the shot . The 1AC may need to use a measuring tape to check the exact distance between the camera and the actor to make sure things are exactly in focus , which requires walking into the camera 's field of view during shot setup . Obviously during live production you ca n't have somebody stopping the scene to measure , or repeating a take because focus was n't right so you \" stop down \" the lenses or use different lenses so you do n't get the nice soft background and more of the scene is in focus . When framing shots in single camera , you can put the camera right next to an actor 's face to get an interesting shot . But when shooting live , each camera has to stay out of the field of view of every other camera which limits how interesting and varied the shots can be that you can get . One camera person walking right up to an actor would be visible to the other cameras , ruining their shot in a live production so such gags would have to be * very * carefully planned . Then , in editing you would only pick the nicest looking takes , which is obviously impossible when shooting live . Then you send the project off to color correction where the image gets tweaked and refined until it looks like the director / DOP and colorist want it to . This is probably the biggest shift in the image that you are noticing , but it is the hardest to explain . Look for some colorist demo reels on vimeo , and you 'll see some idea of how much the image sometimes gets changed during coloring .", "Two main reasons . One , the cameras used in Live TV are often smaller and lighter , with a single color processing chip that results in less color distinction . Cameras on set are either higher end with multiple color processors , or still use Film . Post processing on higher end cameras allows for more polishing and tailoring forthe final product . Two , live TV is typically recorded at 30 frames per second ( or higher ) . Classic film and TV are shot in 24p ( 24 frames per second ) . This is what gives the biggest difference in the \" feel \" of live vs others . This is also why newer 120Hz+ HDTVs have that akward unnatural feel if you 're watching a show shot in 24p but being displayed at much faster refresh rate . In order to make up for the missing frames , the video processor speeds up and slows down certain frame sets ."], "input_length": 41, "output_length": 279.6666666666667, "length": 320.6666666666667, "all_classes": "null", "language": "en", "dataset": "longform_qa", "_id": "b1d44812bb4e5b3065b75460e3469ad878285641f2d96763cdc8c5427c8ac540"}

EDIT : Thanks for your helpful answers , guys ! Explain like I'm five.", "context": "", "outputs": ["Actually , how wings work is a fairly simple concept made needlessly complicated . I 'll try to explain . Imagine a flat piece of metal moving through the air , it 's flat side is hitting the air \" head - on \" . Now I think most people would agree that just in front of the piece of metal there 'd be air \" bunching up \" , there 'd be slightly higher pressure in front of the plate since it 's sort of pushing the air out of the way and the air ca n't get out of the way fast enough . This means , of course , that just behind the metal plate there is * less * air and less pressure , the air is getting pushed out of the way by the plate and it has to rush in behind it to fill in the void at the back . This is essentially drag , we 're all familiar with this and it 's vital to things like drafting . But now comes the interesting part : Tilt the plate forwards , let 's say by 45 \u00b0 . Now your high pressure area is going to be slightly * below * the plate and the low pressure area is going to be slightly * above * . And as you can imagine , if you have high pressure below and low pressure above , you 're going to be pushed * up * and that is basically how wing 's work . Why is this important ? Notice that nowhere did I mention the wing has to have a special \" airfoil \" shape to it . In truth , the airfoil shape of wings is not strictly necessary . It 's there because it makes planes more efficient but really you can get perfectly good lift from a flat piece of metal . A wing will still generate lift when upside - down because it 's fundamental shape has n't changed : it 's still pretty much a flat piece of metal . The fact that the airfoil shape is now upside down only means that the wing is less efficient , so the plane may be slower and probably a bit more unstable , but it * will * still generate lift . The important thing is having that flat piece of metal and angling it correctly towards that stream of air , that angle is the vaunted \" angle of attack \" .", "[ Try the NASA page , its a little easier to read , and there 's a tool to see variations of lift based on angle of attack ] ( URL_0 ) But basically on a plane flying upside up , the wing will generate a finite amount of force up ( called lift ) for various angles that it is vs the wind ( aka angle of attack . ) When it is pointed down enough it will actually create a force that pulls the plane down . You can see that pretty well in the applet , when the angle is -4.03 degrees or so it crosses over that line . Now if you were to flip the plane over the negative sign reverses ( if you do n't see why , ask and I 'll explain that a bit better ) so that the wing would have zero lift at 4.03 degrees and if its more inclined it would produce lift . At 8 degrees it 'd have roughly 250lbs of lift . That airfoil shape is cambered , which basically means its not symmetrical ( same top as bottom ) and that is why the zero lift angle is not zero . IF the airfoil was symmetrical , you might be able to \" see it \" better when you thought about it flying upside down . in that case , the shape of the wing would be the exact same no matter which side you had up , so it would lift just as well upside up as upside down . Sorry if its not at a 5 year old level , but I do n't honestly think you wanted it that reduced . If you have any questions on what I wrote , ask away .. I 'm going to bed now , so it 'll probably be a little while before I get back to you ...", "The thing is , lift is created partly by the shape of the wing , and partly by the angle of attack .

Most of the time though , the answer is ' sort of . ' A Hasselblad Stellar is entirely identical to a Sony RX-100 except for the case , but when it came out , sold for about five times the price . In this situation , the markup was entirely based on the cachet of owning a Hasselblad . ( Note : It did n't work . The design studio has been shut down , and the Stellar is selling for about 70 % off now . ) In general , a big part of the cost of a camera is derived from the sensor - specifically , the size of it . The Nikon D7100 is quite similar in design and features to the D600 , but the sensor in the D600 is substantially bigger ( full - frame ) , and the camera sells for about twice the price . Does the sensor cost that much more ? No , not really - but building a camera around it requires more engineering as well . Now if you have a built - in lens , your optics are going to get better as the price increases . That 's a HUGE factor in the price of a camera . Ultimately , cameras follow the same curve as almost every other consumer product : As you move from the low end to the high end , the improvement / price starts out high , then moves to a fairly steady value , then drops off . Say that to make a ( separate ) camera at all , you 'll have to sell it for $ 75 . That 's the base cost of making a body , shutter , electronics , and lens . Double the price , and you get MORE than twice as good of a camera - higher precision , better autofocus , more features , bigger and better lens , bigger sensor , the works . Double it again to $ 300 , and you get about twice as good of a camera as the $ 150 was . Another doubling , and you get about 1.6x as good of a camera . Now we 're getting into the diminishing returns area .

Is a $ 2400 camera twice as good as a $ 1200 ? Nope , definitely not - but it 's significantly better in a few ways , and those factors might be enough to get you to shell out the difference .

The higher end cameras have much finer quality control in the manufacturing process . The crispness and brightness of the image is all dependent on the path the light takes from lens to processor , so you can imagine a perfectly manufactured route for the light is far superior to a lower quality one . Have you ever seen those youtube vids where kids will set up a rube goldbergian style path for a ball to bounce into a red solo cup ?

{"input": "Why is n't it considered corruption when politicians grant access to lobbyists in return for financial gain . EDIT : Since lobbyists give campaign donations and receive access to politicians in return , why is n't this considered corruption ? Please explain like I'm five.", "context": "", "outputs": ["Hi- I 've been a registered lobbyist in the US so I can give you a perspective different than most of the others here . First , when a lobbyist gives money , they 're probably not giving their own money . Instead , they they are giving money from a Political Action Committee which collects money from other donors . Corporations can also have corporate PACs . This is important because lobbyists are speaking on behalf of others . In the US there is a constitutional right to petition government . Donating to political campaigns is also recognized an as expression of free speech . The US also has a strong tradition of legal representation -- Americans generally want a lawyer to advise them on issues in the courtroom whereas in some other , often authoritarian countries , you do n't have that luxury and are forced to navigate a complex legal system you do nt understand by yourself . So when a lobbyist donates money to a politicians campaign , they are ( 1 ) assisting donors to exercise their freedom of speech and ( 2 ) assisting donors to petition their government . Lobbyists are specialists , just like plumbers or lawyers . They understand the byzantine way that a government works and they can provide expert advice about what is realistic , what is ethical and how to accomplish a goal . So , now the question is , does money equal access . The answer , based on a long history of studies is -- yes . Money does get you access . But you can also get access when you do n't give money . And you can be ignored even if you do give money . Getting in the door is really hard and really important . I ca n't tell you how many hours I 've spent just trying to figure out how to get into a room . That said , getting into a room does n't get you anything more than face time . I 've sat across a coffee table from members of congress who loathed the group I represented . Being in their presence did n't get me anything ( other than making conservative members of my group happy that i reached out ) . I do not agree that corruption is getting in the room . It does n't actually get you anything . Getting something is ... well ... getting something .

I personally believe in 100 % public financed campaigns and a prohibition on any contribution or in kind contribution . It will never happen , and the reason is not because politicians wo n't let it happen . The reason is that the public wo n't let it happen . Politicians are n't any different than anyone else .

I try to answer this without bringing my own opinion into it : Most countries have some forms you could ( depending on your opinions ) call legal corruption . For example : some democracies have non - professional parliaments - that means that the law - makers have their own job and business and only go to the parliament twice a year or so ( Switzerland would be an example for such a system ) . This means , of course , that these politicians have economical interests . You could argue , that this is some kind of corruption , since these guys will vote for their interests . On the other hand , people who vote them into the parliament know this . A teacher might vote for another teacher and a farmer for another farmer - since they know they will have roughly the same interests . In the US it is legal to donate for political campaigns - but you have to do so un - anonymously . So you are free to see , who finances Obama and who finances Romney .

Voltage would be the speed of the water both in the hose and coming out the end of the hose . How does this help us understand transformers ? Let 's say you want to increase the voltage of the electricity . This can be done without having to raise the power supply at all , using what 's called a transformer . Put your thumb over the end of the hose- suddenly the water starts shooting out , and you can feel the increase of pressure under your thumb . The amount of water passing through any given section of the hose at any point in time has not changed at all , but by shrinking the opening with your thumb , in order to keep the current constant , the water has to speed up coming out the end , which lets you [ spray your backyard enemies ] ( URL_1 ) with a more effective water laser . How does a transformer actually do this , since there 's no real \" hole \" to shrink ? Easy ! Take a piece of metal ( your transformer 's \" core \" ) and wrap your wires around it like [ this . ] ( URL_0 ) ( Please note that the transformer setup in this diagram would do the opposite , and * decrease * the voltage ) All moving electric charges ( in this case , the electrons moving through the wire wrapped around the left side of the core ) create a magnetic field . As you can see , the left side has fewer turns than the right side . The electrons in the wire on the right are influenced by the magnetic field created by the ones on the left , and they begin moving . This creates an \" induced \" current in the right side . Energy must be conserved ! Because there are more coils on the right , there are more electrons under the influence than you started with ! So the voltage decreases ( or increases ) based on how many turns of wire are wrapped around each side . Unfortunately , there is one discrepancy with the hose analogy- the current in the wire has to increase if the voltage decreases , ( so that energy is conserved across the transformer ) and vise versa . The core plays a pretty important role , too ! It magnifies the electromagnetic effects because it is full of electrons that mimic the ones in the wire . Does that help ? ( It 's been a looong time since undergrad so if I 've bungled it anyone is welcome to correct me )", "Magnetic fields induce voltage into conductors ( like copper wire ) . To increase a magnetic field , one trick is to coil copper wire . The flow of electricity creates a magnetic field along the length of the wire , but it is relatively weak . If you coil the wire , the field compounds it 's effects and changes it 's magnetic flow to be around the entire coil instead of the wire alone . Certain materials are also used to further increase magnetism by allowing magnetic field lines to move . Like electricity , magnetic field flux lines move through materials differently . Magnetic field flow is called reluctance . Iron is very reluctant , and allows the magnet field lines to become stronger . Placing an iron core inside a coil increases the magnetic field strength , which increases the ability it has to induce voltage into a nearby copper conductor . Smaller coil , higher voltage , next to a large coil , and you 've stepped down the voltage , but what you lose in volts has become amperage .

We even take a close look at how fast the galaxy is rotating at different points , for example the middle , the outside , and places in between . From what we know of mass , gravity , and motion , we would expect that far edge of a galaxy would rotate slower than a spot closer to the middle . If you make a graph of the speed stars are rotating about a galaxy versus how far away they are from the center , it 's called a rotation curve . That graph should look like a children 's slide . It goes up really quickly from the center , and then slides down and down as you go towards the edge of the galaxy . The problem is , it does n't .

This is affected by what 's in the air ( humidity and pollutants definitely ) , but even more so by the temperature . As the temperature increases , the molecules in air vibrate and need more space , so they spread out more . So when an area is really hot , the air pressure pushes anything that 's dense ( say , clouds ) further away into low pressure ( lower temperature ) areas . Since it 's air moving , it 's wind . Air pressure can do this at varying elevations ( how high in the atmosphere the area is ) and places spread over the actual earth . The spin of the earth also has an effect , but it 's not something you would notice in just your local area . The effect the earth 's spin has is mostly at a global level , creating the [ Westerly Winds ] ( URL_0 ) . Since temperature has an effect on the winds , you can see where big spans of ocean or mountains can mess with the pattern too . If two cross breezes ( winds going in different directions ) are just right and form in seasons of specific temperature patterns , they can cause hurricanes and cyclones on a large scale or tornadoes and dust devils on a smaller scale .", "Wind is air that has someplace else to be . It happens because there is too much air in one place and not enough in another . This is LI5 after all .", "I remember being five and being confused about The Wind . I knew it was made by cars . You do n't even have to be inside a moving car to feel the wind that spews out of them . For awhile I was sure that wind came out of the clothesline poles in the back yard ( they make a weird whistling sound . ) Obviously it was coming out of the ground , then going up all the clothesline poles in the neighborhood , then spewing out of the T - shaped pipe ends . Thus the \" aolian notes . \" Hmmm , on second thought it might have been my father that told me about this when I asked where wind comes from . Anyway , back when I was five , my main error was thinking that air was nothing . We all walk around in empty space . Obviously ! Wave your hand around ... there 's nothing there . It certainly is n't like being underwater . WRONG . Spending life immersed in the atmosphere is almost exactly like being under water . Air is n't heavy like water of course ( air is only a couple of KG per cubic meter . ) But think : you can not feel the weight of water while swimming deep in the pool . So if air was a heavy fluid , we 'd never know this . AND FISH DON'T KNOW THEY'RE WET . ( Probably fish think they have antigravity super powers . I would . ) One way to tell that heavy air exists would be to open an umbrella and then wiggle it in and out , then close it up and wiggle it again . While open , it feels VERY heavy . That 's the extra mass , the heavy blob of air that it has to move . So my 5yr old self needed to know : we 're living under invisible water , but we do n't know it . But this type of water is n't very heavy . When the water starts moving across the landscape ... that 's what wind is ! Clouds of dust are really colored air : dust clouds are just like dumping some dye or dirt into clear water . The 5yr old inside me then realizes that wind must always blow in circles .

This interdisciplinary field combines neuroscience with the psychological study of personality , emotion , and mood . \" It also examines how our own neural mechanisms are mirrored in animals ( and especially mammals ) because of shared ancestry . The study of motion is definitely a very active area of science that permeates many different fields - evolutionary biology , animal behaviour , human behaviour , animal communication , human communication , origin of communication , psychology , psychiatry , neurobiology ... each look at different questions concerning emotions . In ELI5 words this means that animals are certainly capable of feeling emotions because the neural mechanisms that produce emotions are conserved through evolution , and are similar to the neural mechanisms that produce emotions in ourselves . All mammals , being related through common ancestry , have even more similar and conserved mechanisms - humans are of course mammals too ! But a few things to note : 1 . The way animals express a particular emotion may differ from the way humans express that emotion . For example , humans often smile to exhibit happiness . But for the rest of the primate order smiling is either a signal of submissiveness or fear . This does not mean that other primates are incapable of feeling happiness , but that they very likely express it in different ways from ourselves . We also have to be very mindful that other animals , even cognitively complex ones , may be physically constrained and incapable of complex facial expressions . For example , we know dolphins are capable of a lot of complex cognitive tasks , they are able to identify themselves in the mirror and they may even have names for one another ... but they do n't have the facial musculature to make the expressions that are , well , as expressive as ours . Their emotions may not even be obvious for this reason , but that does n't mean they do n't exist . 2 . Humans like to make emotions poetic , like love . But love is simply a kind of attachment emotion . Humans become attached to each other and objects , sometimes to the point of obsession . Animals also become attached to each other .

Explain like I'm five.", "context": "", "outputs": ["To answer your first question ( how do you make this effect ) 1 . Get a picture of a large event where you can see for a long distance within the frame of the picture . See how in the picture you posted you can see many cars close up and also many cars far away ? That 's a good picture to start with ! 2 . Without going into too much technical detail , using a photo editor program you blur just the top and bottom of the picture using a gradient . This means that the top and bottom of the picture will be most blurry and as you get to the center the picture gets less blurry . Congratulations , you just made a tilt - shift picture ! Now , why does it make things look miniature ? Well , this has to do with how your eyes look at small objects . Let 's do a little experiment . Get three little toys and put them on your desk , so that one toy is in front , one toy is in back about 6 inches away , and the last toy is even further back , about another 6 inches away . Now get down towards desk level and close one eye and focus the other eye on the middle toy . You should notice that when you 're focusing on the middle toy the toy in front and the toy in back are blurry . This is because the way your eyes and most camera lenses work , when you 're looking at things relatively close to you ( less than about 1 - 3 feet away ) , the lens in your eye that helps you focus can only focus on a narrow strip at the distance you are focusing . So when you are focusing on the middle toy , only the things that are that toy 's distance away from your eye will be in focus , and everything else in front of and behind the toy will be blurry . This is called * * narrow depth of field * * , meaning that when you are focusing on something close to you , you can only focus on a * * narrow * * strip at the certain * * depth * * ( aka distance from your eye ) of the object you 're looking at in your * * field * * of view . So how does this tie into tilt - shift pictures ? Well basically all these pictures are just mimicking what your eye does when it is looking at small objects close up . The cars closest to the camera ( the ones at the bottom of the picture ) , and the cars farthest from the camera ( the ones at the top of the picture ) , are made blurry because they are in front of or behind the depth at which the camera is \" focusing \" ( remember in real life that the camera took a picture of real , life - sized objects from very far away so it was basically able to focus on everything all at once ) . But , once you treat the picture with the blurring effects , then your brain perceives the picture as if it was taken by a camera up close to toy - sized objects ! I hope that explanation helped !", "First , you take a photo of something , as if you were looking down upon it at 45 degree angle . So the angle already sets it up like it were one a table top and waiste height . Then you zoom in a little bit , to aleviete the effect of perspective , to make it look more like a 2d isometric video game for the SNES or Genesis . Then to photoshop you go ! In photoshop . You jack up the constrast and the primary colours , to make it looke as if it were vibrantly hand painted . Last thing is that you apply degrees of blur to things closer and further away from whatever is in the middle of the shot . This makes it looks like your picture had a very very narrow field of depth , like a macro photo of a model from a few feet away . Voila ! Experiment . Hardest part is getting the right angle , of the right things .

Let 's imagine that the world is a massive playground and each country is a gang , led by a particular kid . Now , one of these gangs is called Libya and it 's run by a guy called Gaddafi who is a little eccentric to say the least . He began slapping about some of the kids in his gang and so a bunch of other kids said that he should stop it . He did n't , so the leaders of the French and British gangs asked the biggest kid in the playground , the US , if they would help them stop him . Obama , the head of the US gang , easn't entirely into this but went along in a somewhat half hearted manner ( possibly because he was n't entirely sure of the the UK and French motives ... they might want to do it for the right reasons , but it might also be because they were getting unpopular at home and nothing cheers up a gang like winning a war ) . Libya is a long way from the gangs who wanted to stop Gaddafi so all they could really do was throw stones at him but on the upside , Gaddafi is so eccentric that he does n't really have many friends and the part of the playground that he lives in is n't very important to any of the other gangs . As a consequence , people could carry on throwing stones at him without anyone getting too concerned . Syria , on the other hand is a different kettle of fish . For one , their leader Assad is certainly a nasty man , but he 's not crazy like Gaddafi . As a result , he does have friends like Iran and aquaintances like Russia . Not only that , but he lives in a really sensitive part of the playground that 's inhabitted by some pretty odd characters . To his south is Israel who are very twitchy and have atomic weapons . They 've had fights with Syria before ( actually , they 've had fights with most of that part of the playground ) and those fights have a nasty habbit of getting out of hand . Further to the east is Iran who are very chummy with Syria and have a lot of power in that neck of the woods . For one , they have a massive influence on what happens in Iraq and there also happens to be a great deal of US troops still in Iraq . They also have the ability to make it difficult for people to get oil and can make other gangs do their bidding . In short , that bit of the playground is a mess and bombing Syria would most likely kick off something far bigger and dangerous . Not only that , but the Syrians are quite handy in a scrap and it would n't be as easy as throwing rocks at Gaddafi . Now , you are right , none of this is very fair because Assad is basically getting away with stuff that Gaddafi got in trouble for .

These four things we want to keep track of become our column names . Now we add a row to the table for each person we want to keep track of .

Obviously you can be detained and then committed to an institution but it 's not because its illegal but it 's under some other law that authorizes such actions if there is a reasonable belief someone is a danger to themselves or others . Granted a lot of the repercussions of this are similar to being arrested for illegal acts , being detained , held against your will in a facility , losing some rights etc . , but there 's also some differences such as not having a criminal record . Assisted suicide is illegal though , and that 's partially because the state does n't want to be involved in trying to determine if someone is guilty of murder or if they were just assisting suicide , and the other part being it 's stance against suicide anyhow . Even in states that have death with dignity acts , they 're not exactly assisted suicide . The terminally ill patients meet with multiple doctors over a period of time and the doctor will give the patient a drug that they take on their own , so the doctor is n't directly involved with the death .", "If its for someone who is terminally ill and in immense pain I think it can be justified , but the bigger question that comes in to play is ' where do you draw the line ?

However when people are in these suicidal states its often described as being almost drunk with the intention . For the ones that recover its often a blurred memory of what happened .

This is a long philosophical debate with no correct answer , and it depends on where * you * want to draw the line and what sort of morals * you * hold . But I guess the tl;Dr of it would be because those who consider suicide are often not in a healthy mental state to make logical and critical decisions . Suicidal individuals are often depressed . They can only see one side of things : the negative side . For example , if a suicidal individual sends you a text and you , for one reason or another , do n't reply , they wo n't take it the same way as a mentally healthy person . We might think \" well he might just be busy or he just does n't want to reply now , \" that is if we think about it at all .

Now that I think about it , I do n't think I 've ever truly had it in me to end it all . I had only considered one side of things and I did n't think about the bigger picture . And when it came to it , had I really ended it all , it would 've been a stupid spur - of - the - moment sort of decision .

In this particular case , there 's a combination of two issues here : ( 1 ) the federal budget , and ( 2 ) Obama 's executive nominations . On ( 1 ) , the Senate had to approve a funding bill by Saturday night , otherwise the government would run out of money and have to shut down again . So the leader of the Senate Democrats , Harry Reid , and the leader of the Senate Republicans , Mitch McConnell , made a deal to vote on Friday to pass funding for enough stuff to tide the government over until next Wednesday . Then everyone would go home for the weekend , and come back on Monday and finish passing the \" full \" funding bill . HOWEVER , under Senate rules , you have to wait a certain number of hours before voting on a bill , unless EVERYONE agrees to waive the rule .

He basically said , \" Reid , McConnell , you agreed that on Monday we can pass this symbolic thing saying Obama 's an unconstitutional tyrant Kenyan Muslim socialist , or whatever , but that 's not good enough - we have to do it NOW . \" So he and Mike Lee refused to go along with waiving the time requirement .

If they HADN'T moved that step forward on Friday night / Saturday morning , they would have had to do it on Monday , which means that the next step would have come at the end of next week , instead of the beginning / middle . And if they came at the end of next week , there 's a much better chance that a lot of Senators would be gone home for Christmas , and when they come back next year the Republicans will be in charge and they probably wo n't get passed .

Look at it this way , most people , even people who are economically below average , have a much higher quality of life than wealthy people did living a thousand years ago . Therefore they are more \" prosperous \" than these wealthy people . And certainly , if you are more prosperous than a wealthy person , you must yourself be prosperous . But no one considers these people to be prosperous , because as human beings we must think of things relatively , we must have some frame of reference . Even for the same person we can modify whether or not they are prosperous based on whom we are comparing them to at a given moment . We can say someone is poor , or unprosperous when we are thinking in our mind of the United States but if someone were to say , \" yes but what about compared to the rest of the world \" , we would think about Africa and India and such and perhaps say that yes this person is prosperous .

Stocks for well - run companies that make lots of money by selling great products are like really cool beanie babies that are well taken care of . Other stocks are for companies that are like ugly , dirty or worn - out beanie babies , so people wo n't want to pay as much for them . * How common is it ? If a beanie baby is really easy to get , it wo n't be as expensive as if there are less of them around . In the same way , if a lot of people want a stock but there are limited shares , its price will go up . * What do the experts say ? Does the beanie baby have a label that says it 's really rare and nice ? People put labels like that on stocks too , and just like beanie baby labels they affect prices a lot more than you might think . * What fads or trends are going on right now ? If a certain beanie baby shows up in the news or has a role in a popular movie , it 'll suddenly be a lot cooler even though it 's the same beanie baby . Beanie baby prices also go up right before Christmas every year . Not all stock prices move like that , but a lot of them will move the same way from year to year . * What other toys are popular ? Sometimes no one wants to buy beanie babies because another really cool toy or video game is more popular for a while . Stocks have rival toys too , like bonds or commodities or foreign currencies . For the record , five year olds should not be investing in the stock market .

The villagers , seeing that there were many monkeys around , went out to the forest and started catching them . The man bought thousands at $ 10 and as supply started to diminish , the villagers stopped their effort . He further announced that he would now buy at $ 20 . This renewed the efforts of the villagers and they started catching monkeys again . Soon the supply diminished even further and people started going back to their farms . The offer increased to $ 25 each and the supply of monkeys became so little that it was an effort to even see a monkey , let alone catch it ! The man now announced that he would buy monkeys at $ 50 !

In the absence of the man , the assistant told the villagers ; \" Look at all these monkeys in the big cage that the man has collected .

{"input": "How accurate are IQ tests and how useful are they ? I do n't understand whether they are an outdated tool or if they are useful in predicting things like success , failure , salary , violence / crime , etc . Help ! Please explain like I'm five.", "context": "", "outputs": ["Well , we can rule out the online \" IQ \" tests as shams , there is no point in believing them . As other in this thread have pointed out , you need to give a proctored IQ test if you want a reasonable estimate of your IQ . Now we come to the question of whether having a higher IQ gives a person a significant advantage over someone with a lower IQ . To answer this I 'm going to draw deeply on what I read in Malcolm Gladwell 's Outliers . He gave the example of a man , who is quite possibly the most intelligent man on the planet ( his IQ is 40 points over Einstein 's ) . This genius was a Bar Bouncer for most of his adult life , he now lives on a farm and works on physics theories but he does n't even have a Bachelors degree to his name . In the end , he did n't live up to his potential . Another good example that he gives is of the [ Genetic Studies of Genius ] ( URL_0 ) which is a study conducted over decades to track the children in the state of California back in the 1910s who gave a proctored IQ test and were deemed geniuses . After tracking these kids through most of their lives the study found that some of them became exceptional in their fields , but many of them went on to live mundane lives , not doing anything equivalent to what their IQ suggested they were capable of doing . So why was this , why were n't these kids who were the top 1 % of the IQ bracket not the leading lights of their fields ? It 's because humans are more complicated than that . Emotions , personality , attitudes , the willingness to work with others are just some of things you need to succeed in life . Additionally , just because someone has a higher IQ does not preclude him / her from mental illnesses . Additionally , Gladwell also points out that most jobs in our society just need us to be of average or just above average IQ ( around 115 - 120 ) this is enough to graduate from college and work in demanding jobs such as engineering , architecture , investment banking . Most of us actually fit into this bracket ( as someone described , its a bell curve ) . Beyond this bracket , additional IQ points wo nt make significant changes to your earning potential / career . IQ is relevant but only as one of many important attributes a person should have , willingness to work with others , a good attitude , good values , and the willingness to work very very hard are all part of this mix . You ca n't determine what a person is like , or might turn out like if you just look at one small part of what makes him who he is . tl;dr - Lots of people with high IQs did n't do well in life . Most people have sufficient IQ to handle most of the jobs that society has to offer . You ca n't understand a person just by his IQ , you need to look at his values , personality etc .", "It depends on the format . The online tests ? They 're useless . If you 're going to try to apply for a job and you 're \" smart \" ? Dumb it down ... they 're looking for a 90 - 110 IQ and if your'e too smart you 'll be flagged as \" not a fit \" If you really want to know your IQ ? You need a proctored test . Will it help you ? Nope . If you 're smart ? Great . That does n't pay the bills . If you 're really smart ?

{"input": "What is homeopathy ? Please be civil , I see that reddit feels pretty strongly about it , but please answer without being too opinionated ^_^ Please explain like I'm five.", "context": "", "outputs": ["Homeopathy is the idea that very tiny amounts of things that cause particular conditions can be cures for those conditions . For example , if a certain herb causes nausea when eaten , a homeopath might believe that very tiny amounts of that herb can cure nausea . This belief has no basis in modern science , and in fact a typical homeopathic drug is so dilute that it contains literally no molecules of the original substance .", "Homeopathy is one of several forms of alternative medicine , this means that you can use homeopathic remedies instead of traditional medicine remedies . The former uses \" medicaments \" ( based on the [ * miasma theory * ] ( URL_0 ) and [ * water memory * ] ( URL_1 ) ) , I wo n't talk about that theory here . The remedies are often prepared by a \" homeopathic dilution \" . In this process the substance that homeopaths think will cure a disease is diluted with water or alcohol . Imagine you have , lets say , some vegetal dye ; you add 1 mL in 1 L of total solution , so , this stock solution has 0.001 % of dye . According to water memory , water has the capability to retain the qualities of the substance previously diluted in it , so , if you dilute this stock solution to one tenth , you will have 0.0001 % dye in your solution ( 1 mL in 10 L ) but the water will still have the qualities of the first solution . With this reasoning , if you re - dilute the second solution to one - tenth , you will have a solution with 0.00001 % dye ( 1 mL in 100 L ) and the same qualities of the stock solution . Going on with this reasoning , you can have a 0.00000001 % dye solution ( 1 mL in 1 000 000 L ) that will have the same qualities as the stock solution . Lets take this example to reality . Dilute 1 drop of dye in a glass of water . The water will turn into the colour of the dye . Take a drop of this solution and dilute in another glass of water . The water may be slightly dyed , but not too much . Take a drop of this solution and dilute in another glass of water . In this point you will certainly do n't see any dye at all . Take a drop of this solution and dilute in another glass of water . Would you drink this glass of water ? Would you be afraid to get your guts dyed ? Repeat the latter . How about now ? Is this solution still dyed ? Certainly , no . The big deal with homeopathic medicines is that they have the same results as placebos in clinical studies . That is , you compare a liquid homeopathic medicine vs. distilled water . If , statistically , the number of people cured with the homeopathic medicine are about the same as the number of people cured with the distilled water , homeopathic medicine does n't work . To add another layer of comparison , use a traditional medicament as well ; if this medicine outperforms the placebo it means it is really working as a medicine . To accomplish this results , you need a double blind administration of medicines ( neither the person giving the medicine and the person receiving it know which one of the three they are receiving , they only know they are giving / receiving a medicine for the disease ) . I did my best to give a not - too - opinionated answer but , as you may have noticed , homeopathy is a total scam based on pseudoscience . The fundamentals in which it is standing completely neglect our knowledge of very basic chemistry .", "Homeopathy is classified as a pseudoscience , like astrology . this is because no scientific study has ever shown a homeopathic remedy to be any more effective than a placebo .

Instead , you 're supposed to dilute that substance in a solution so many times that none of the original substance remains .

Similar circuits can be built to subtract numbers . Another thing electronics can do is store numbers in memory , and load numbers from memory . Eventually , through combinations of these circuits , one big circuit , a processor , is made . The processor starts by loading a special number from memory . That number is the first command it executes- encoded into a number so that it can be stored- after that , the processor loads the next command and so on . In order to get those commands in place in the first place , other electronic devices were used that just set the memory one section at a time . There was no \" First OS \" , though , since operating systems slowly evolved out of this technology of storing commands in memory . At some point , a computer was designed that could both load commands from memory and take user input to store new commands in memory- that may be what you consider the first OS .", "Like you were 5 ! Computer does not need OS to be able to program stuff . Computer needs OS for example , to be able to run multiple processes at the same time .

Analogy , computer with no OS is like you had a deck of cards , and put them down on table , one by one , on top of each other in a single pile . Faking you do two processes at the same time , what the OS does , is like you putting them in two different piles . What the cards are here , is the time given for program to do it 's stuff . If you put more cards to one pile , or not , is comparable to OS deciding which processes it should give more time .

This means that 2/3 of Congress would have to agree on something . It takes a lot of political willpower to get that to happen . My guess is too few Americans understand the E.C. well enough to pressure their representatives to change it .", "In 1787 : There was a fight between the big states and the little states . This deal calmed both sides down since it helped both sides . The bigger states got more electoral college votes , but the smaller states are over - represented . How are smaller states over - represented ? Every state gets at least 3 votes , no matter how small they are . Then , you get more votes as your state gets bigger . So let 's say you have a state that has 100 people in it . It 's very small . Here , the three votes are divided among 100 people , so each person 's vote counts for .03 of an electoral college vote , which are what actually decide the winner . In a bigger state , though , there are 200 people . That 's enough to get 2 more votes , since you get an extra vote every 50 people ( after the first 100 ) . These 200 people are sharing 5 votes , so each person only gets .025 of a vote . Obviously , .03 is more than .025 , so people in the smaller states have a bigger electoral vote . That said , the bigger state still has more votes than the smaller state , so it has a bigger all - around impact . Today : In addition to needing 2/3 of Congress to agree ( which is pretty hard ) , you 'd need 3/4 of the STATES to agree to changing the Constitution . This would NOT happen because the small states like how their votes count for more . If it was just a national vote , everyone 's vote would count for the same . you would need 37 states to OK the amendment , and you would not have enough big states to pass the amendment . A possible solution ? Even though the winner is announced on election day , the electoral college votes are n't actually cast for a little while . You need 217 electoral votes to win . Let 's say you have a lot of states who do n't like the whole system . In fact , you 've got so many states who do n't like the system , if you combined all of them together , you 'd have more than 217 electoral college votes . You get them all together , and you agree to vote for whomever wins the most votes nationally , even if that 's not who your state voted for . That way , you do n't need the small states to agree with you , you just need to gather up 217 votes . Still pretty unlikely , but a man can dream .", "When the US was formed , there was a debate one how the states should be represented . Little states wanted one vote per state , big states wanted to vote by population . As a compromise , Congress has two houses , the Senate , where each state has the same number of votes , and the House of Representatives , where each state gets vote in proportion to its population . In this way , the interests of big states and little states were balanced . The Electoral College is a reflection of this . Each state starts with 2 votes , then gains extra votes depending on population . So a state like Wyoming gets 3 votes , instead of only one , and gets a little more say in the election . The Electoral College served other purposes in the past , but most of them have become obsolete . It has only clearly disagreed with the popular vote once ( Harrison vs. Cleveland , 1888 ) . Three other times ( Adams vs. Jackson 1824 , Hayes vs. Tilden , 1876 , Bush vs. Gore , 2000 ) the loser of the popular vote eventually became president under extenuating circumstances .

In effect , Florida 's governor has made it a law that everybody has to give him $ 40 .", "Okay basically people do n't like drugs for alot of very good reasons . Drugs cause people to do bad things to get them and when their on them people do n't always think straight . Now in the USA if your very , poor you can be supported by the government . This takes the form of food stamps ( Things you can exchange for food ) , medical insurance ( Called medicaid ) and program to help you find a place to stay . The idea of these program is to provide a safety net if a person fall on really hard times . Now the problem becomes ... what happen if a poor person is using drugs . Many people think if a person is using drugs , then they have enough money to buy their own food . So the government by giving them food stamps is just enabling their drug use . And because drugs are bad the government is doing harm so they should stop giving them support . Other people think that drug are very addictive and that these poor people probably are n't able to kick the habit . So even if the government was n't giving them support they 'd still be drug users ... they just be drug users with out food or medical insurance and they 'd be in a even worst state . A third group think both of these ideas are irrelevant because the USA has no right to test people for drugs . The constitution say that the government needs a warrant to search someone and a drug test should be considered a search . They are going to court to prove their point . Another problem is that testing people is expensive . If your doing drug test your using money that could be spent helping people . Often this money that is being used from drug test is often going to companies that are heavily involved in politics . Further more not all drug show up equally in these test . Marijuana for instance show up on the test for a very long time , which cocaine does not . Also poppy seeds can cause a false positive on the test because Heroine is made from Poppies . There are many other points but these are just a few .", "Well , it 's a complex issue with very polarized sides but the way it basically breaks down is ... On the surface , it does n't sound like a bad idea . After all , who wants the government to be paying to fuel an addict 's habit ? However , a closer look at a few key things show why it might not be as \" innocent \" of a proposal as it initially seems . The first bit is the cost . The amount of people that use welfare money for drugs is somewhere under 10 % -- probably even under 5 % but as I do n't recall the estimate , lets say 10 . Problem is , you have to test * everyone * if it becomes a law . So right off the bat , you 're mandating testing for 90 % of welfare folks that do n't do drugs but you have to anyway . The problem is , drug testing is n't cheap . Whether the government sets up its own lab ( buy cheap tests in bulk , but have to hire tons of people and train them to process all the results ) , or if they go through a 3rd party company ( more $ $ per test ) , it 's going to cost a lot . Couple this with the fact that in order to be effective at catching abusers , they would have to test more than once a year . It adds up quick . The last point I want to mention is that with the case in Florida , the governor 's wife is involved with a drug testing company being used in the new mandate .

Explain like I'm five.", "context": "", "outputs": ["I 'll try and make this really simple . A citizen 's arrest is when a regular person ( who is n't a police officer of any kind ) arrests someone who has committed a crime . In the US the rules vary slightly from State to State , but in general anyone can arrest a person they see commit a felony . They then have to hand them over to the police promptly . The difference between this and a police arresting you is that the police can arrest you for crimes someone else saw and then tells the police about , where a citizen can only arrest you for something they see happen . It works the same way a regular arrest would , it could be the citizen simply saying , your under arrest and then waiting for the cops to come , up to full on handcuffing and the whole 9 yards . In some states , if you citizens arrest someone , and you were n't legally justified you might face civil lawsuit for doing so . URL_1 URL_0", "Ok , this is n't easy to answer , because we have many states in our country , and they all have laws that can be slightly different . So the answer is going to have to be general , and you 're going to have to realize that in one place it may be different than another . The way a citizens arrest works is that you , as a good person , see someone else being bad . So you tell them \" You are under arrest ! ! \" in your best big - boy voice , and then you call 9 - 1 - 1 and the police come to take them away . Now there are a few things to have to do to make sure you do this right . First off , you have to SEE the person do the bad thing . You ca n't be told by someone else and then go grab the person . This is called \" Witnessing the crime . \" Second , the bad thing they do has to be what 's called a \" felony . \" Now , there are two types of crimes in our county , Misdemeanors and Felonies . Misdemeanors are the little crimes , like slapping someone or stealing candy from a store . Felonies are the big crimes , like really hurting someone on purpose , or robbing a bank . So if you see someone doing something wrong , you need to think , \" Is this a big bad , or a small bad ? \" If it 's a small bad , you need to call 9 - 1 - 1 and let the police handle it . If it 's a big bad , though , and if you do n't stop the person RIGHT NOW someone can get hurt , then you can step in and arrest them . Now there are certain things you need to do once you 've arrested them . First off is make sure that when you are talking to 9 - 1 - 1 ( you already called them , remember ? ) you tell them what you have done . This lets the police officers know that they have to get there faster , because arresting someone when you are n't a police officer can be dangerous . Secondly , you ca n't beat the person up . They may have done a really , REALLY big bad , like hurt a little kid or even killed someone , and you are going to be very , very angry . But like Mr Rogers says , \" Being mad is ok , but you ca n't hurt people because you are mad . \" Now , you can \" defend \" yourself if the person tries to hurt you . That means you can fight BACK , but you ca n't start the fight . But above all , if you see someone doing something bad , call the police . They are the ones who go to school to be police officers , and they have all the tools there on their belt , and they know all sorts of things about laws and dealing with someone who wants to hurt you or other people .

Ok , harmless enough . The Attorney General headed this committee , but Nixon added on a guy named G Gordon Liddy ( who had gained Nixon 's trust by helping him with the first election and stayed on for the first term ) to brainstorm some bolder ideas . Liddy originally proposed some crazy shit : hiring prostitutes for a boat full of Democratic politicians and take a bunch of photos , kidnapping Democrats and keeping them captive in Mexico for awhile , and , oh ... breaking into the Democratic Committee 's office and wiretapping everything . Attorney General Mitchell originally rejected it all , but Liddy kept pushing in future meetings , and in a weird compromise , Mitchell ended up saying \" fine , fine ... no prostitutes or kidnappings , but we 'll keep the wiretapping , happy ? \" And so G Gordon Liddy and some help broke into the Democratic Committee 's office , cops came , busted them . FBI found out Nixon paid the burglars and tried covering it up . Big problem .", "TL;DR : Nixon , president at the time , send some guys into the Democratic National Committee HQ ( located in the Watergate office complex , hence the name ) to snoop around and place some wires to know what the Democrats were up to .", "The thing to recall is that Nixon was by nature a paranoid person and the times they were a changin ' . The other thing to recall is this was the era of Vietnam wind - down and post Summer of Love . The national culture was changing . Lots of talk in back rooms about ( godless ) commies trying to take over America using hippies as their tools of destruction , that sort of thing . ( Recall further this was all that long after the Red Scare era in America . ) So Nixon represented a defense against the perceived social upheaval , if not advance of communism , which would take place if McGovern won the election . This was an election of bitter social divides . Some people who believed so fiercely in the need for Nixon to remain in office were willing to do illegal acts in order to assure same . The justification was as President Nixon was above the law , that whatever he did was legal since he was the President . This was called \" Executive Privilege . \" The rest is well - recorded , of course . They got caught breaking in , which led to the discovery of a slush fund used to finance such ( not ) illegal things which led to the growing realization that Nixon participated in the effort to cover everything up ( and this is where it gets good ) which led to the growing realization that the President would be up for impeachment and would likely be subject to same . It also caused a supreme court case which forever removed any doubt that the President was not , in fact , above the law . So he resigned , thereby maintaining the rather cushy lifestyle a Presidential pension allows . It really shook up the country . This was the era post Pentagon Papers , where people realized we were being lied to about the Vietnam war , and then the whole cultural revolution of that same era . Worse came the post resignation case taken to the supreme court . See , Ford , the VP , became prez after Nixon resigned , and the first thing he did was issue a pardon to Nixon . ( I ca n't remember the case name but ) a case was taken to the Supreme Court questioning if this was a just act , since at that point Nixon was so obviously criminal . The Supremes voted that it was constitutional for Ford to issue the pardon , since not doing so would create so much turmoil in the country . Which is to say the Supreme Court decided some people were above the law , in effect .

Wifi networks tend to be more concentrated and numerous than cellular networks so it can get a more precise location .", "I wrote my final work at university about localisation with wireless networks . The problem with it is it sucks . You can talk it pretty and i did it a lot in my work because i wanted it to sound good and usable . But if you have any other possibility of localisation it is a lot better than triangulation with WiFi networks . But there is one important reason to use it , indoor navigation . As soon as you enter a building you will most likely lose your GPS signal and your great localisation ability . And Wifi is a great way to close this localization gap . And it is good enough to tell you in which room you are ( as long as you are in bigger rooms ) but errors of 5 meters or more are something that will happen a lot . The main problem with Wifi localization is that it 's usually done by checking the signal strength of the wifi network and it differs a lot , it depends on weather , humidity , materials used and even how many people are around . It 's really hard to make a model that takes all of those factors into consideration and is able to give a good localization result . In addition to that there 's the problem that modern routers usually have some kind of energy saving option that will disturb your measurements even more . There may be some exceptions to this , some museums / supermarkets have a very controlled area where weather / humidity and routers do n't change that often . This allows you to have a rather good localization indoors . Another possibility of improving your localization would be the pure mass of wifi networks , for example in a skyscraper filled with flats and wifi networks - the pure mass of information will give you a rather good position . And in both of those cases GPS is n't available or a viable option to rely on , which makes WiFi not only the best but the only way to locate your phone . Edit : and of course to use WiFi to locate your phone you need to have a database that tells you where all the different WiFi routers are . It may come from Google cars or a supermarket may provide the exact positions . For better advertisement or guided museum tours , where the WiFi is set up to be used as a localization tool . And i should mention that you can use special algorithems that fuse gps and wifi localization but if you compare the additional energy consumption you need to the improvement in your position it 's usually not worth it at all .

Simply put , as more data is collected things like location gets more accurate . Wireless Access Points nowadays also have additional antennas that are for polling the area and seeing who is passing in and out of their signals . They actually do some really incredible stuff called \" presence analytics \" where they log if you came in to range , connected , or simply passed through a WAP .

To find the area of a rectangle of sides * x * and * y * say , we just multiply the two numbers together and write * xy * as the area . - To measure volume , we use THREE numbers .

After they re - worked the path of the pipeline to spend as little time around water reserves the state government supported it . However Barack Obama came out swinging indicating that he would veto any request to make the pipeline until a review has been done . Congress just passed the bill for the pipeline where it will go on to the Republican dominated Senate who will vote it to the president who will potentially veto it . Since he 's dealing with a Republican Senate and Republican Congress he can potentially lose power to do anything if he does n't sign the bill into law . The other major controversy is around EU propaganda in regards to the oilsands . It 's worth noting they 've since retracted and denied such propaganda . The EU claimed all oilsands are \" dirty oil \" because they pollute more than other oils . EU was getting oil from Africa which had their own oilsands projects which were n't getting the dirty oil designation ... because the EU bought oil from them . However now that Russia 's oil is out the dirty oil designation is gone . There was also unfactual information stating that fuel made with bitumen ( oilsands ) is less fuel efficient than regular oil . In reality America has been getting bitumen for quite some time now ( because as you can see the map does bring oil from Canada into the United States ) . Basically any environmental protester has tried to spread as much misinformation as possible . The information as it was ( that the oilsands contribute 3 % of the total carbon emissions for the world ) is damning enough without making stuff up . It 's a politically tenuous issue that divides the left and the right in both Canada and the United States . If you are against the Keystone XL you are regarded as a liberal and if you are for it a conservative . Because the debate is designed this way there is no way to talk to the fanatics on either side .", "Pipes leak . They always do . A very long pipeline will leak on a lot of currently pretty pristine land . A lot of the intervening land the pipe must cross are native reserves and many people accuse the oil companies of coercion or bribes to get permission for some of the land , and that it 's really not in the best interests of the people that live there who are already having enough trouble with access to fresh , clean water and the like . It 'd fan the flames of the operations on the Alberta tar sands , which are controversial in their own right . Getting oil from the tar sands is obscenely bad for the environment . Continued reliance on oil is also per se a controversial issue . Many people would rather not make oil reliance easier to encourage development in other directions ."], "input_length": 39, "output_length": 256.3333333333333, "length": 295.3333333333333, "all_classes": "null", "language": "en", "dataset": "longform_qa", "_id": "7ceeb18a97d00f64add5631cd1e41a6989b2170b7aa34144a1976039b754c701"}

I 'll give an example ( i have many of them like demand / supply and import /export driven etc , but I 'm on my phone so I 'll give you only one ) . For simplicity , Let 's assume my nation of 10 citizens uses a stone chip as a currency and your nation of 10 citizens uses glass chips . And we start off trading on 1 stone chip equals 1 glass chip . Now imagine , My nation some how found itself in a depression and decided to pick up few more stones from the ground and decided to call it money . ( like the Fed reserve prints money out of thin air ) . So every one in my nation has plenty of those stones already ( worthless at this point ) . Would you still sell me your 5 glass chips worth of product for 5 stone chips ? I.e. We could easily bankrupt you by taking your products and hand you worthless stone chips . Edit : for clarity", "It 's all about how much people will pay in one currency for another currency . In some ways , currencies are like stock shares in the issuing country . You might consider the total amount of money that exists in a given currency as the market capitalization of the country . Shares / currencies rise and fall in value relative to other shares / currencies as public opinion changes about the long - term stability of the company / country . The Yen and Ruble have been falling relative to the dollar lately because the prevailing opinion of the stability of the Japanese and Russian economies is faltering . The US economy appears to finally be strengthening again , so people holding Yen and Rubles would rather sell short to get into Dollars than hold those currencies and wait for them to rise again .", "Flexibile exchange rates are determined by the world 's demand and supply for the given currency . Individual people , investors , firms , and governments all demand a certain amount of a country 's currency at a point in time and that country will supply a certain amount of that currency . If the supply of the currency remains constant ( i.e. their central bank does not print more of it ) and more people decide that they want to buy more of the currency , the currency will appreciate and it will become more expensive to purchase . The opposite happens if people decide they do n't want the currency anymore and decide to sell it . A flexible exchange rate is important for many countries because it can act as a tool the central bank can use to help out the domestic economy if the economy is too heated or if it is in a recession . Because the central bank manipulate 's the interest rate in the domestic economy , they indirectly manipulate the demand for the domestic currency and thus indirectly affect exports and therefore aggregate demand . How does this happen ? Say , for example , the US is going into a recession . The Federal Reserve can then lower the interest rate in the American economy . When this happens , many of the American bonds investors can choose from will now have a lower interest rate which means they are not as valuable compared to other bonds in the world , say Canadian bonds ( holding all else constant ) . Investors will then decide to sell their American bonds ( or not buy any at all ) and sell American currency so they can exchange it for Canadian currency and invest in Canadian bonds which have a higher rate of return and are more profitable . The act of investors selling American currency causes the supply of American currency to increase , and if we hold the demand constant , the American currency will then be worth not as much . If American currency is not worth as much , American goods and services will be relatively cheaper , so foreigners will demand more American goods and services because they are cheaper relative to other foreign goods from other countries . The result is that the American economy begins to export more goods , and this means more jobs in the American economy , and so the economy will begin to heat up again and the impact of the recession will be smaller ."], "input_length": 38, "output_length": 255.66666666666666, "length": 293.66666666666663, "all_classes": "null", "language": "en", "dataset": "longform_qa", "_id": "b2941bc0782fa7da201264aefd1de13ebe763cfd6d6015bc6eccff786bb9e689"}

Please explain like I'm five.", "context": "", "outputs": ["If you take things and put them together , they will slowly fall apart . This happens on every scale , from the stellar to the molecular . Stars burn out , buildings crumble , organisms die , and molecules break apart . You can fight against it ( new stars can form , buildings can be repaired , organisms reproduce , chemical reactions can create new molecules ) but eventually given enough time , everything will come apart .", "Yikes .. the amount of misinformation here . Yeah the whole idea of everything moving towards disorder and decay is very poetic and somewhat based in a scientific principle , but firstly that 's the 2nd law of thermodynamics , not a definition of entropy , and secondly I 'm pretty sure a junior engineering student is aware of that simplification and looking for something a little more scientifically rigorous . Disorder is one definition , but a somewhat ambiguous and debated term these days . It makes it easy to grasp at first , but as you learn more can lead to some confusion and the kinds of misinformation I 'm seeing here . Granted I 'm no expert either , but here 's my take : Entropy you can consider a sort of measure of how easily or impossibly reversible a process is . For a more tangible example : an object falling from a higher place to a low place is a relatively small change of entropy . Assuming the system as simply the object , you need to input energy into the system ( pick it up ) to restore it to it 's old state but that 's pretty easy . Let 's say the object cracks during the fall . Well the change in entropy just got a little higher because you got ta do some more work ( input more energy ) to mend that crack . Now say the object shatters into a hundred pieces , it will be even harder to restore it . You 'll have to work to pick up all the pieces , rearrange them back to their original state , and then somehow bind them back together . Thus that 's a much higher change of entropy . And so on .. In physics this concept is important because things naturally want to go to a state of higher entropy ( 2nd law thermodynamics ) , enough so that it can happen spontaneously without outside input . This is what drives so many things , like heat flowing for hot areas to cold areas or pressure gradients in a system tending to equalize or dispersal of particles . Entropy is how you describe that change . In a closed system , if ice melts in water , the ice got warmer but the water got colder , and the total heat / energy in the system is the same ( ignoring heat of fusion ) . In a closed system , if a bunch of grouped together particles dissipate and spread out , the overall mass / density of that system is still the same . So what changed ? And that 's where the concept of entropy comes in as a measure of that change . Um , so that 's more the classical definition . The concept has evolved beyond just physics and I think the definition then really depends on the application .", "It 's just probability . Consider all the possible outcomes of tossing a hundred coins , and make a histogram for number - of - heads . Obviously there 's precisely one outcome for 0 or 100 heads , 100 outcomes for 1 or 99 heads ... and ramping exponentially up to squillions of combinations with 50 heads . Take a given layout of 100 coins on a table , thwack the table with your fist to make coins jump in the air , and you 're pretty much guaranteed that your random change will result in N getting closer to 50 , rather than closer to 0 or 100 . Now repeat the same experiment with hot and cold molecules in a glass of water . There 's a hell of a lot more ways for them to be more or less evenly distributed than there are for them to be separated .

One way to protect a network from DDOS is to just have LOTS and LOTS of bandwidth and spread your information over LOTS of servers . which of course takes LOTS of money . Another is of course proper network security , a firewall looks for and blocks non important or false network traffic , they try to filter out basic attacks and block repeat signals so that you can free up bandwidth and make yourself harder to hit . Of course the big corporations have very expensive and well maintained firewalls , but no wall is immune if the attacker is dedicated , persistent and willing to do the work . and the last ability a company has to defend themselves are their network maintainers / defenders . These people are supposed to be able to see the attacks as they come in and modify the firewall to customize it against the attacks coming in . Most hacking attempts , specially BOT nets , use a one size fits all attack . Each computer firing the same type of \" ammunition \" so a skilled defender can see the pattern and tell the firewall to ignore those packets . But it requires a lot of skill and costs a lot of money to maintain a full time skilled network defense . Most companies have an outside source that they can call upon to protect their networks . Once the attack occurs , they can call up the company to have someone come out to fix the wall and stop the attack . You 'll also notice that most of these attacks are only for a few hours at most and that 's why .

( Most of these will be picked up by the compiler because they will result in what is called a \" syntax error \" , but some of them , if they are syntactically correct , will compile ok . ) - The programmer implemented the design as per the specification , but the specification was wrong I 'm sure there are more , these are just the first ones that spring to mind .", "Professional software engineer here . The most common types of bugs are : 1 . A logic error . These are most often just mistakes made by the programmer . The mistake might be because the programmer had a momentary lapse of concentration or because they did n't quite understand something . For example , testing that two things are equal when the test should have been if they are * not * equal . 2 . Lack of or poor error handling . For almost everything that can be done in software , there are at least 3 other ways in which that might go wrong . Trying to write to a new file , for example , might fail if a file with that name already exists , if there are permission problems , if the disk is full or a quota is exceeded , if another program is simultaneously trying to write to the same file , if the file system has become corrupt , if the system is running out of memory and a whole host of other things . Handling these cases is an important part of writing a program , but because many of them rarely happen in practice and programmers can be lazy , they 're not handled correctly or at all . So most of the time the program works fine , but on the rare occasion when the disk is full , for example , the program does n't properly check for and handle that error and does something unexpected . 3 . Mismatching expectations from different programmers . Often programs contain code written by more than one programmer , and these different pieces of code must work together . Well engineered software is broken down into separate independent components that can be independently designed , implemented and tested . Sometimes when two components that appear to work fine independently are used together , something goes wrong . They might both be stepping on each other 's feet by fighting over the same resource or one might try to use the other , but expect it to work slightly differently from how it actually does . 4 . The programmer makes assumptions that are not necessarily true . They might be true on the programmer 's own system where the program works fine , but if the program is run on a different system , it might fail because the assumptions are no longer valid . For example , they might assume that another program is already installed , or that the OS is installed to the C:\\ drive .", "Programming with no bug is essentially the same as telling stories with no kind of inconsistencies ( in the facts , the scenes , the thought patterns and emotions of characters , any kind of inconsistencies . ) For extremely short ones , that might be doable , though surprisingly hard .

The opposite gendered wolves and dogs are simply put off by the hybrid , hence wo n't have sex with it , and that 's enough to make them dogs and wolves not the same species .

Laborers are serfs who have no control over capital and usually no political power . Capitalism - The means of production is controlled by the bourgeois , who can buy / sell / exchange their capital for other capital and goods . Laborers are the proletariat who sell their labor in exchange for money which they can use to buy capital and goods . Socialism - This is where things get hazy . In socialism the means of production are controlled by the state but owned by the people . What makes things tricky is that , in socialism , everyone has ownership of the means of production , so there are no proletariat and no bourgeois anymore , but there is still money and the exchange of labor for money . Socialism has never really existed . Communism - Marx himself never defined communism , but famously said that in communism a man could fish in the morning , write in the afternoon , and hunt in the evening . The idea is that there is a post - scarcity society . In other words , there is so much wealth that no one * * needs * * to work , but can choose to work whenever they want to get whatever they want . The closest thing to communism is what you see on Star Trek , esp . TNG .

This coup was carried out with significant American and British support , and was done to maintain British control of Iran 's vast oil resources , because Mosadegh had plans to nationalize the oil companies . The shah 's regime was also unpopular because it was undemocratic and there was a lack of civil rights and liberties , including political prisoners and extrajudicial executions . The ayatollah Ali Khomeini had lived in exile for a long time because of his opposition to the regime , but he was popular with Iranians and after the initial stages of the revolution in 1979 , he returned to Iran and was greeted as a hero . A new government was formed and Iran 's government is very complicated .

A team brings the football under control into the opponent 's end zone . Point - after attempt ( \" PAT \" ): 1 pt . Immediately following a TD , a team has the option to kick ( in the NFL ) an easy field goal through the posts . The ball starts at the opponent 2 yd line . 2 - point Conversion : 2 pts . Another option for the offense after scoring a TD . The offense must bring the ball under control into the opponent 's endzone , much like a touchdown . This also starts at the 2 yd line .

Setup : Two sides of 11 line up against eachother on a \" line of scrimmage \" determined generally by the last point of forward progress by the offense . The ball must be placed between two \" hashmarks \" each several yards inwards from their respective sidelines . This often results in more open play to one side of the ball .

They may move the ball primarily by running or passing it . Forward passes must be thrown from behind the line of scrimmage . Defense : The defense must stop the forward progress of the offense by tackling ballcarrying players or legally interfering with passing . Turnovers : If the offense fails to attain a first down , the defense receives the ball . This often results in a punt by the offense on 4th down ( if they are out of range of a field goal ) in order to gain favorable field position .

So your body makes it easier for these white blood cells to get to the dead cells by pumping up the muscles with extra water . That 's called \" inflammation . \" Unfortunately , if too many cells died from the particles , the body goes overboard . First , it pumps too much water into all your organs .

Maybe open new shops , maybe open a gallery or musicspace , etc . This is all good - and the area remains affordable .

Middle class folks start pouring in - but there 's still plenty of options for the poor ! The only people you 're evicting are squatters and druggies ( due to increased police presence ) Eventually - the demand for luxury housing grows .

The degree to which these profiles are accurate tends to increase with the number of data - points ( e.g. crime scenes ) that the profiler has to work with ( i.e. that are believed to be linked to the same offender ) . Profiling specific details ( e.g. a particular car model ) can not be done with any sort of accuracy unless the profiler has additional information ( e.g. physical evidence or eye - witness accounts ) which leads him / her to make such a conclusion . It is possible , however , that certain evidence may lead the profiler to suspect the criminal drives a certain type of vehicle . For example , evidence may suggest that the crime was politically motivated and the offender is an environmental protection activist . It may therefore be predicted that the offender drives an environmentally friendly electric / hybrid car . If , on the other hand , the criminal is suspected of being a hunter and weapons enthusiast , it may be predicted that he drives a utility truck of some sort which has lots of storage space . Criminal Profiling is still a hotly debated topic in Forensic Psychology because - although many profiles do turn out to be quite accurate - there are many criminals who are eventually caught and do n't end - up matching the predicted profile . The forensic utility of profiling is still questioned and it 's important for people to realize that these profiles are merely educated guesses and law enforcement should not eliminate or ignore suspects who do n't fit the suspected profile . Source : Degree in Psychology & Criminology .", "Most of the traditional \" real - life \" FBI profiles are more demographic - based than psychology - based . That is , they figured out that most rapists and other predatory sexual criminals started at around X age , grew more criminally sophisticated ( and often more violent ) as they committed more crimes , had certain types of experiences and behaviors in their background ( abuse , neglect , voyeuristic behavior , violence toward animals ) , etc . Based on that data they 're able to predict certain things about an offender with a certain degree of accuracy : age ( or at least experience level ) , race -- since most sexual criminals tend to victimize those of their own race -- background / living situation , and so on . In addition , there are certain other things that are more specific . For instance , if a murder is carried out \" military style \" , then they might surmise that the killer has military or law enforcement experience . If the crime scene is haphazard or disorganized , they may surmise that the killer is less experienced and probably younger , while a \" neater \" crime scene indicates someone who 's been at it for a while .

Hedging instruments are instruments that can be used to lower your risk . For example , if you are a farmer and you know you will produce 100 gallons of milk per day for the next year , you can pre - sell that milk on a futures or forwards market , thereby reducing your risk . This is called hedging . On the other side of your hedge might be a cheese manufacturer who wants to guarantee their input costs and therefore also hedge using futures contracts . Unfortunately , the amount of people who need to hedge do n't perfectly balance out . In come the speculators . These speculators take the other side of the deal allowing the counter - party to hedge . What 's more , the speculator is seeking a return while the hedger is seeking a guarantee , so often the speculator demands a price that favours them , allowing them to earn outsized returns . In this example , if we expect milk to sell at $ 100 next year , the farmer might be happy to lock in a price of $ 98 , which would give the speculator an expected $ 2 gain . In reality , they might end up owing $ 10 if the price ends up at $ 88 , but on average , they trade a good return for the farmer 's security . What 's more , the Hedge fund does n't have to put much money down to buy this contract , since all they are doing is making a promise to pay in the future . Futures , forwards , options , and leverage ( borrowing ) are the typical tools Hedge Funds use to speculate on the market and get exaggerated returns . Hedge funds buy or sell these in combination with the underlying asset ( in this example , milk , but more commonly , stocks or index funds ) to exaggerate the moves in the market . If they correctly bet on an asset increasing in value , they can get more than 10x the market return of simply buying the asset . Conversely , they can also fail miserably . They are high risk and for this reason , you are n't supposed to invest in them unless you are an accredited investor . We tend to believe that they are extremely successful because of survivorship bias . For example , if you look at any hedge fund that exists today and you ask how much they made over the last ten years , almost all of them did extremely well . The reason of course is that the hedge funds that did badly over the recession no longer exist and wo n't be part of your database .

So the protons which are usually + are now - , and the electrons that are normally - are now + . The problem with anti - matter is that it does n't really belong in our universe ( there could be other universes in the multiverse made entirely of anti - matter ) . So , when an anti - matter atom comes into contact with any regular atom , they cancel out in an explosion . Anti - matter is very very expensive to manufacture , and we can only make a few atoms at a time . If we could create a teaspoon of anti - matter , it would bankrupt every country of the world . ( Reply to this if you want me to explain how anti - matter is made ) EDIT : Well for the anti - protons , they have to take atoms and collide them at near - light speeds , and very seldom they get an anti - proton ( which must be handled with great care due to its explosive nature ) . Anti - electrons , or positrons , they are naturally emitted by the sodium-22 ion . They just pair them together and you have anti - matter . EDIT 2 : It has been theorized that anti - matter is actually matter flowing against time ( i.e. going backwards in time ) and that is the reason why the antimatter - matter explosions are so large is because they are cancelling each other out of the time stream . Dark matter on the other hand is matter that does not have any physical form , but we know it exists because we have detected gravity where it is . Gravity is much like a tarp . If you put a heavy object on it ( like a sun ) it will bend , and other objects on the tarp will circle it ( planets ) because it creates such a dip . But with that , you can see that the sun is causing the entire tarp to dip . With dark matter , it appears as if the tarp is dipping by some invisible force . There are several theories about this , but the most predominant one is that dark matter is actually matter from other universes in the multiverse that are in different dimensions . More to the point , gravity has an easier time bleeding through dimensions ( imagine the dimensions as pieces of paper on top of each other ) , and that 's why a great deal of our universe is filled with dark matter .

The people of the States therefore did what they knew would really piss off the Brits - they chucked a load of tea into the Boston Harbour . The British authorities saw through the Native American disguises the terrorists / freedom fighters were wearing and the whole thing escalated into the Revolutionary War following the 13 states ' Declaration of Independence . The Colonists did n't decide on war with the British , war was thrust upon them when the Redcoats arrived to suppress the revolt .", "Many of the colonists , or their ancestors left Britain to get away from religious laws . Starting with the Puritans and Quakers . So there is already a ready made population with anti - government sentiment . Add to that the frontier mentality that if a person did n't like laws and control he just went west and started a new farm out of sight of the authorities . When government does happen in the colonies it tends to be small and local not driven from overseas . Then the French and Indian War happens . Britain spends an extraordinary amount of money protecting the colonists from their enemies . Those colonists are developing larger and larger towns and cities and expect the Crown to protect them not just do it themselves any more . The frontier mentality is being lost in the cities and towns . In response after the war the British government does several things which basically pisses off every colonist possible . First they establish the Proclamation line of 1763 . No settlement west of the Appalachians , that is now reserved for the Indians . No more running from the authorities by going west . And as the colonist see it setting up a place the Indians can gather and prepare to attack them in peace . This pisses of all the frontier minded people , and all those who chafe under government control . Second they decide its time the colonists paid for some of the defense that has already been provided in the war , and will be provided in the future . They impose various taxes on goods : The Tea Act , The Stamp Act and restrictions on how trade is conducted . This pisses off the merchants in the cities and those who in the past would flee west ca n't anymore and stay in the east as dissenters . Third the colonists are given no say in these policies . Not only will the government in England impose unwanted regulations you do n't get a vote or even the right to complain . That privilege is reserved for people in Great Britain . Now as dissent and unrest increase the British use the army now stationed in the colonies to stop it . They send out raids into the countryside to seize guns and powder . They garrison the worst of the cities not paying the taxes , and they impose more taxes to pay for this further angering the colonists . Its a downward spiral . The more the colonists resit the stronger the British clamp down which causes the colonists to resit more . All the while the British do n't even consider letting the colonists have a say in determining real policy for the colonies . In truth the taxes were not that bad . They were less than someone in GB could be expected to pay .

If u ask why , it probably has to do with the influences of other languages in that area , as well as the linguistical history . Some people can just stop speaking in their accent when they want to . That s how we fake accents . It of course requires a conscious effort to stop reverting back .", "Good question ! First off , accents are often solely based on geographical factors . In America , for example , accents in the south tend to have a \" drawl , \" where words are accented in different places . Compared to their northern counterparts , who tend to speak with word accents in their dictionary defined areas , there 's a night and day difference . You may be thinking , \" well , that 's all fine and good , but where did these accents come in the first place ? Why do n't we all speak with the same accent ? \" The answers to these questions can be specifically attributed to the evolution of a language . Sticking with English here . English itself is typically said to have three stages , Early English , Middle English , and Modern English . Geoffrey Chaucer , a poet in the 14th and 15th centuries , wrote his English in a manner we would scarcely be able to discern in modern day English . This is important because Chaucer 's English is still categorized as modern English . This passage from his Canterbury Tales shows just how different the language has come in a few hundred years . Whan that Aprill , with his shoures soote The droghte of March hath perced to the roote It 's important to factor culture into this discussion , since culture is the main reason why language evolves . Words like ' troll ' , ' booty ' , and ' YOLO ' , have all derived from modern day pop culture . In the past , language changed almost exclusively due to literature . It 's said Shakespeare alone contributed 1700 unique words to the English language . From there , certain factors such as literacy , socio - economic status , and even certain health issues all contribute to language , and as consequence affect accents . Over time , as populations migrate and collect in dense areas , these factors blend and transform into new accents . The reason why you see a stark difference between the south US and northern US is due to who primarily settled there . In the south you had rich landowners , who , to separate themselves from the rest of the population , brought their \" proper \" language with them from Europe . This , mixed with the many African dialects that came over in early America , has evolved into what we hear today . Merchant class citizens typically settled in the north . Later Scandinavian influence ( especially in the midwest ) has evolved into what we hear today . As for changing accents ... You actually can and will develop a new accent over time if you find yourself among a population who has a completely different accent to you . I 'm a Minnesotan . We typically have a very recognizable accent in that we often pronounce our ' o 's with a long syllable . When I visit family from as close as Indiana I notice my accent starts to change ever so slightly to have more of that drawl . Spend enough time around different accents , and your accent will change . TL;DR Accents and languages have their own evolution . Social factors have a huge impact on why we speak the way we speak .

They were based in Constantinople ( modern Istanbul ) and are the primary branch of Christianity found in the Middle East , Greece , far Eastern Europe and parts of Western Asia for most of Christianity 's history . The Catholic Church is based out of Rome . It was the primary branch of Christianity in the Western Roman Empire , and therefore the primary branch in Europe . It is lead by the Pope who is considered God 's word on Earth . The liturgy was only in Latin until the 1960s though it is not uncommon for it to still be held in Latin . The Protestant Churches first started to break off during the Reformation ( or Protestant Reformation ) that started as an attempt to correct the corruptions of the Catholic Church that failed and so broke away from the Church no longer recognizing the Pope as an authority . Over the centuries they broke up further based on various disagreements on doctrines to form all the various denominations that are common today . Some of them do use different bibles that include more or less books than the others ( namely Catholics and Greek Orthodox having the apocrypha ) . And there are a wide variety of differences such as who can lead in a church , how baptism is done ( and if it is required for salvation ) , how communion is done ( if it is open or closed , if it is weekly , monthly , quarterly , etc ) , if worship includes instruments or not , and many many more differences .

Unless they 're panicking over something external , most people having a panic attack mistake it for a heart attack . Tingling in extremities , rapid heartbeat ( caused by all that fast breathing ) and so on . Try putting on a metronome ( you can get apps for a smartphone ) to help whoever 's panicking get a sense of time passing . When you 're panicking , your brain starts perceiving everything faster and time slows down . This will also help regulate their breathing . A good pace for breathing is 4 - 7 - 8 : in for four , hold for seven , out for eight .", "I am not a doctor . This is not medical advice , but I have lived with three different people prone to panic attacks and learned this that way : * * What happens during a panic attack * * ( Please note : there may be other things at play : this is the \" what happens \" that I know about , and I believe is most common , as I know several people who suffered from these . ) A panic attack is triggered by something - often specific to the person suffering , or sometimes they just happen on their own . The panic response ( in everyone ) triggers heavy breathing to get as much oxygen into the blood as possible ready for a fight - or - flight response . However , in a panic attack this heavy breathing ( hyperventilating ) is overdone , and it actually makes it harder to breath . The sensation of not being able to breath causes new waves of panic , and so it continues . * * What you can do * * Firstly , do not panic yourself . The first time I saw someone have a panic attack I thought she was choking on someone , and started trying to hit her on the back . That was n't so helpful , as it turned out . You should be the paragon of calm . A panic attack is not dangerous . If someone really overdoes the hyperventilating they will trigger a \" breathing reset \" sort of thing , which sorts out their breathing and they quickly calm down . Even if this does n't happen ( which I 've never known to happen ) the worst that can happen is that they 'll fall asleep , but anyway . Secondly , be comforting . One person I knew who was prone to them had flashbacks to a traumatic event that triggered her . By hugging her closely , and talking to her I 'd override her flashback - senses with real - world - here - and - now senses and bring her out of the flashback and she 'd calm down quickly . To her I said things like \" You 're okay , you 're safe . You 're here with me now . Look at me , nothing here can hurt you ... \" etc ... Another person I knew had more random ones . With her I 'd do the same , but try to get her to focus on deep breaths . With a third person I tried the deep breaths thing , but she said it only made her want to punch me , only she was too deep into panic mode to do so . With her I 'd just hold her , try to say calming things and use the tightness of my grip ( tighter , gentler , etc ... ) to try to subtly adjust her breathing and found that worked . Thirdly , talk to them . Some people do n't like talking about it , but you can talk about how to help them . This means you find out what makes certain people want to punch you , or useful things like the \" bring them out of flashbacks \" and stuff .", "Deep breaths to ten and back .

They do n't heal after they are formed because once a tissue can not really change it 's function . Scar tissue does not have the same qualities as skin or muscle or whatever it \" should be \" and it ca n't become something it 's not . Your body is also not really capable of dissolving it later or replacing it , the scar just sits there . It does gain some flexibility over time and tends to change colour but it 's still scar tissue . EDIT : just for reference here 's a better explanation . Your tissues are designed to heal asap . There is no functional benefit to the skin taking it 's time to regrow and reconnect the tissue properly . This is the same basic idea behind blood clotting ; it 's a bad idea to simply wait until the blood vessels heal after they are cut , so rather than make it look pretty , a crappy clot just forms over the wound . With wound healing your body is just trying the patch the tissue ( eg . skin ) as a defence mechanism to protect against infection . A scar is basically just a mass of disorganized tissue held together by a bunch of collagen fibres .

Basically you have two different mechanisms for healing 1 ) Scar Tissue ( This is what you are referring to ) 2 ) Regeneration ( This is what happens with tinier scars that can undergo mitosis ) Scar tissue basically happens when you damage part of the body that can not undergo mitosis ( mitosis is when your cells multiply , divide , and repeat to replace the damaged area ) and is unable to heal completely . Like if you imagine had a paper cut . It usually replaces itself over the course of a week and you may have some discoloration that will fade with time . Now imagine receiving a deeper cut , like cutting you hand with a knife , or bit by a squirrel ( verified ) . This damages a layer of the skin that was n't designed to regenerate because it can not undergo mitosis . As a result your body has to find a different way to repair the damage . Scar tissue is the bodies way to fix the damage by isolating the damage since the cells around ca n't repair the damaged area . This also means that if the damage is large enough and no cells are close by scar tissue can form . Even if the cells can regenerate . Let me try to think of an analogy Imagine grass right ? Let 's say that something happens and part of the grass ( Cells ) dies . Either 1 ) New grass will take root and start to grow where the old grass ( Mitosis ) was or 2 ) the dirt ( Extra cellular matrix or cells that under go meosis ) that sustains the grass will be washed away . So what grows in its place ? Another type of grass or weed ( This is glue in the wood block ) .

So here you have a market who wants your product and wants it now , and ca n't or wo n't afford it . I 'm not saying it 's ok , but this is the catalyst that allows people to justify it . The way the industry works is an artist is contracted to produce content for the publisher , they do n't own their own songs , and they 're literally lucky if they get any money , at all , from the sale of their media . Artists make money by performing , and even then , they 're responsible for the cost of the production , which cuts into their profits .

Please explain like I'm five.", "context": "", "outputs": ["I 'm going to go off the assumption that you do n't know what tor is , if you do then feel free to skip the next paragraph . The entire idea behind tor is that by bouncing your information through different relay points , each of which is secured and the data transfers between them are encrypted , thus making your communications much harder to trace back to you . If I turn on my computer and use a regular browser , lets say Firefox , my computer requests that a specific bit of information from , lets say , reddit . My request is sent from my computer , to my ISP 's servers , to the servers of the website and then takes the little bit of information , lets say a specific webpage , and then does that same process in reverse . Taking the information from the servers of the website to the ISP 's servers and then back to my computer . Tor complicates this process by , rather then doing a straight line of data from computer to ISP to site , first encrypting all the communication and then secondly bouncing that signal / request for data around before submitting the request for information . This has the effect of making you appear like your in another place and posses a different IP address then you actually do . Simply put , a Tor node is one of the small parts of the jump that obfuscates your physical location and IP address by bouncing your information . An exit node is a tor node that serves as the ' exit ' point from the tor network and sends the actual request for information from the site . Hopefully that clears this up , if you have anymore questions just ask . :)", "Tor is an encryption system that bounces your data between dozens of computers around the world , each computer unravelling one layer of encryption that tells it who to send it to next , to make it tough to trace . Each one of those computers is a node , and the one at the end of the chain - where your data hits the rest of the internet - is an exit node .", "TOR is a routing system and stands for ' The Onion Router ' because it works in layers , just like an ogre or an onion . A TOR node is a node that participates in a TOR network , i.e. a server somewhere on the planet . The exit node is just the last node in a given configuration , i.e. the node just before the server you want to reach . TOR is used to hide the identity of the user . TOR works like this : you take your message and encrypt it with multiple encryption algorithms - one for every TOR node you want to route through . Thus layers . You do it in the following order : the most outer layer is encrypted so the the very first TOR node and only the very first TOR node can decipher it . The second outer layer is encrypted so the the second TOR route can decipher it and so on , and the last layer is encrypted so that the exit node can decipher it . This means that if you send your message to the first node he gets rid of the most outer layer . The message is still scrambled and unreadable because there are still as many encryption layers as there are TOR routes left . Now , provided you use end - to - end encryption on top of using TOR this system becomes pretty good at hiding your identity because for every single node in the configuration the node only knows where any given message came from and where it has to go . It does n't know if it 's the first one that got the message or the last one and it does n't know what 's written in it . So , unless every single TOR node in a configuration is corrupted you can be sure that your identity is hidden ."], "input_length": 34, "output_length": 237.33333333333334, "length": 271.33333333333337, "all_classes": "null", "language": "en", "dataset": "longform_qa", "_id": "866a18535c9f6d2769c5cca8276aefef79b303fd37b888c5788a30d119fbcff7"}

More fuel and bigger engines mean you can go further , but also means you need more fuel and bigger engines to lift them in the first place . A nuclear reactor of any kind is a complex , heavy and cumbersome thing , certainly when compared to a ( relatively ) simple oxygen / hydrogen / kerosene ignition system . Ultimately , it 's just easier to get the required lift and speed from burning some chemicals together than it is from heating hydrogen and expelling it at high speed as would be done in a nuclear rocket . The alternative , a nuclear pulse rocket , has huge drawbacks in terms of its waste products ( see below ) . Also , consider the safety aspects . When a chemical rocket explodes - as they have a tendancy to do now and then - you 're left with a big fire , some debris and maybe some unpleasant and hazardous materials from burning plastics / metals .

This angered the agrarian types since New York was the business center of the country . Thomas Jefferson in particular did n't like New York as the capital . So one day Alexander Hamilton , the secretary of the treasury approached George Washington about paying off the country 's debts from the Revolutionary War . Washington told him to talk to Jefferson , the secretary of state . Jefferson proffered that he 'd help Hamilton if Hamilton agreed to move the capital to somewhere near Virginia . Hamilton agreed and now the capital is Washington , DC .", "Generally the legislature decides , and when they do , it 's generally based on geography . And yes , the absolutely can change , it 's just not as common nowadays . For example , I 'll take you through the history of Georgia 's capitals ( since I live here ) . Savannah , on the coast , was the first city established in Georgia , and it was the de facto \" capital \" during the time when we were still a colony ( since we were technically governed by England , but the royal governor sat in Savannah ) . When we became a state , Savannah was named the state capital mostly because it always had been . As the state expanded , the population started shifting west and so Augusta , a little further up and west , was chosen as the next capital partially because it was nearer to the new center of the population and partially because it had served as a rotating capital with Savannah whenever the British were constantly laying siege to it during the Revolution . Augusta was the capital for a little bit before they moved it to Louisville , which did n't amount to much . In 1802 , governor John Milledge sent out a party to find the new geographic center of the state and there they would establish the new capital . The surveyors found a natural spring bubbling up close enough to the center , and so decided to establish Milledgeville as the new capital ( and eventually my home town :D ) . Milledgeville served as capital through the Civil War , until 1868 . During Reconstruction , the military governor of Georgia ordered new delegates to meet in Atlanta . Atlanta became the official capital for a few reasons . First , it was a rebirth from being burned down by General Sherman ( even open - minded , progressive liberals in Georgia gag at the mention of his name ) , and it gave Georgia a new start away from its Confederate capital . Also , Milledgeville is surrounded by hills , which made it hard as hell for trains to get in . Atlanta , on the other hand , is relatively flat and actually began life as a train hub called Terminus . It also was a bigger , more modern city on the rise . So the decision was pretty easy to make , and Atlanta 's served as capital of the state ever since . TL;DR : It 's the legislature deciding where to put the capital , and they can change relatively simply .

Vocal music is considered the highest form of music in India because the voice is God - given whereas instruments are man - made , albeit with the explicitly stated aim of trying to sound as close to the human voice as possible . As Indian music has its roots in devotional rituals , and melody is thought to have grown out of specific religious chanting whereby individual syllables and words of sacred verses had to be recited in a strictly prescribed pitch or tone , the human voice was always revered as something that contained immense mystical properties given the ability to evoke a sense of awe in listeners and performers alike . More crucially , although music by itself is said to carry the power to transform human hearts and help listeners connect to larger reality , vocal music has the added advantage of being able to verbalise a given emotion whether as direct praise of God or other deities or saints or as an expression of a specific human sentiment or emotion . Many good vocal compositions carefully match the given poetic sentiment to the actual emotional aspect of the raag in which that poetry is composed . Some compositions have such strong lyrical connotations that even when they \u2019re played as purely instrumental versions , the original lyrics , although un - sung , appear to be at the forefront of the performance . It \u2019s worth noting that while vocals are considered superior to all other instruments , ( for the reasons given above ) , there is no particular hierarchy within the array of instruments and all whether string , ( vina , sarod , sitar ) wind ( flute , shehnai , etc . ) or struck - string ( santoor ) , are considered equal with the further distinction that instruments which can produce melody are , on the whole , considered superior to percussion instruments . Percussion solos are a very recent phenomenon in Indian music and percussion \u2019s traditional role has always been to play \u201c second fiddle \u201d to a vocalist or instrumental soloist . But where newcomers to Indian music are concerned , the exact reverse order seems to apply in terms of relating to a new and strange musical tradition .

Some airports have made use of low ceilings in places where they do n't want people to linger , like the front of the check in line . edit : check in , not check out .", "The greatest benefit to height is in the event of a fire . Higher ceilings allow more time for smoke and heat to accumulate before affecting things closer to the floor ( e.g. , people , fire load / combustibles ) . The height also can allow for fire suppression systems that cover a greater area with fewer components , such as sprinkler heads . In addition , it is generally easier to control the climate in a larger space with larger air volumes ( exchanges per hour ) that are not as noticeable in one spot . ( Except for those annoying freeze - or - fry areas where air flows are concentrated . ) The air handlers in these systems can also be configured for use following a fire to assist in evacuating smoke from a building , either by exhaust or pressurizing the building ( negative and positive pressure ventilation , respectively ) . Construction costs would tend to be slightly higher because of the longer ( higher ) columns required , which in turn need to be stronger because of ( typically ) larger roof systems such as bar joists or trusses . Such costs can be somewhat offset by reducing the number of columns required . When designers are tasked to create ' open space ' , regardless of low or high ceilings , larger columns with stronger roof systems allow column spacing to be increased , thus ' opening ' the space .

You suspect that it is a strong but light material , like a metal alloy - since initial shake tests did n't break it ca n't be brittle . So you decide to touch magnets to the surface of the box . The object does not move and stays attracted to the magnet . This tells you it is metallic . Since it is metallic and relatively light , you suspect , it is hollow . So , you poke a hole in the box , and fill it with water . Comparing the volume of the box , with the volume of water you filled will tell you the size of the object . From this , you can choose a metal - alloy based on the magnetic strength recorded and estimate how hollow it is . All this has been concluded , without actually seeing the sphere .

They can also be seen on supersonic jet engine exhaust plumes .", "These are [ shock diamonds ] ( URL_0 ) . Rocket engines are designed to operate in space , where there is no atmosphere , and so the pressure of the gases leaving the engine is lower than the surrounding air . The atmospheric pressure compresses the gases leaving the nozzle ; as this flow is supersonic it creates shock waves , which are made visible by ignition of unburnt fuel . [ This website ] ( URL_1 ) has a more complete explanation .", "The SSME 's nozzle runs [ over - expanded ] ( URL_4 ) at sea level , because it 's designed for maximum performance at high altitudes . This means that its exhaust pressure is less than ambient , and so there is an exchange of energy between pressure energy and kinetic energy at and downstream of the nozzle exit plane as the flow tries to sort itself out and achieve equilibrium . Because the flow is supersonic , this exchange takes place via [ shock waves ] ( URL_2 ) . This shock waves produce dramatic local variations in the density of the flow . As the exhaust flow goes through these shock waves , it slows down . This converts some of its kinetic energy into increased pressure energy , which helps it to achieve equilibrium with the atmosphere . However , because of the gas law ( PV = \u03c1RT ) , the rapid increase in pressure drives up the static temperature of the gas ( total temperature is approximately conserved ) . This means that the flow immediately downstream of the shock is both denser and hotter than the flow immediately upstream of the shock . This has a dramatic impact upon how bright it appears to be , because 1 . The amount of light emitted within a given volume of gas obviously depends upon the number of atoms or molecules within that volume , and is therefore proportional to density . 2 . The total radiative power is proportional to the [ fourth power ] ( URL_0 ) of the static temperature of the gas . 3 . The SSME 's exhaust is a mixture of steam and Hydrogen , which mostly emits [ spectral lines ] ( URL_3 ) rather than black body radiation . This means that there is a minimum activation energy to get anything to happen , and so a relatively small increase in the mean static specific energy of the flow may result in a sudden and dramatic increase in radiation . Because LH2 / LOX engines produce an exhaust which contains no carbon , the flame has a very low emissivity , and is mostly transparent ( most of the radiation is actually in the UV range ; the red / pink tint comes from excess hydrogen in the exhaust , which is there because Isp is maximized by running rich and thereby lowering the mean molecular mass of the flow ) .

You can get a better idea of just how over - expanded the flow is from [ this image of a test firing . ] ( URL_1 ) Incidentally , if you were wondering why the Delta IV has a much brighter exhaust despite also burning LH2 / LOX , the reason is that the [ RS-68 ] ( URL_5 ) uses an ablative nozzle to cut cost .

More recently , the main reason for the fight not happening is Floyd wanting to keep his undefeated record , combined with the fact that he 's guaranteed ~30 million , plus PPV upside for every fight . So yes he can fight Manny and make 75 million , but in his mind why take on a fight he has probably a 45 % chance of losing , when he can take fights for 40 million or so against opponents he knows he has a 90 % chance of beating , like a Marcos Maidana .

Routers are in charge of taking those packets and forwarding them to the correct destination . When you watch a YouTube video you are receiving packets of information from a content provider 's servers . Data packets are sent from there through multiple routers ( including your home router ) , eventually hitting your computer . In order to link together multiple Internet connections you 'd need to set up something like ... Multi - WAN or multi - homing , which allows you to \" bond \" multiple lines into what is effectively one line with increased bandwidth .

However , you can run three downloads , and each will run at the maximum speed one WAN connection can handle at the same time . The router can route new requests over whichever of the two lines has the most available bandwidth if you set up the load - balancer correctly . * Most residential routers do not support multi - homing ( at least with stock firmware ) . If you have a router which supports DD - WRT , I believe it is possible , but still very tricky to configure correctly . I 'm not sure if a residential router can support it even with DD - WRT , given that they generally only have 1 WAN port and the rest are switched internally . * Sticky connections are necessary for much of today 's web , and might be difficult to set up depending on what software you 're running on your router . I honestly do n't know of a device that can do this with * * wireless * * WAN links , although it can be done via wired connections .

Then again , why was n't Mike Tyson arrested after biting off a guy 's ear ? The answer , as pointed out in another comment , is that sports largely police themselves . All participants agree to a certain range of physical contact / harm . This \" consent \" makes much of the contact that occurs not really a \" crime \" and , rather , becomes purely a civil issue . This means that players who believe that another player exceeded the appropriate level of harm they consented to can bring them to court . There was a famous case years ago out of the NFL where a player was hit after the play had ended and was paralyzed . The judges had a lot to deal with . One of my favorite comments was something like , \" In a boxing match , boxers do not get to choose which blows they consent to receiving -- rather , they consent to the entirety of engagement . \" Facts that play into whether something crosses a line are ( a ) how often does it happen in the sport ( are the players aware of the risk ) , ( b ) did the act violate the official , enforced rules of the sport , ( c ) what are the penalties conveyed by the sports organization , etc . * * tl;dr :* * \" Arrested \" is something that happens to people who act in a way that justifies temporarily denying them freedom while the court can figure out if a law has been violated ... in many sports , everyone is a willing , consenting participant which makes it more of a civil issue than a legal one . * * Edit :* * Just to add something I mentioned in a different comment below -- another reason that intentional acts of violence are not criminal in a sport even if they are so seemingly outside the scope of being appropriate is that those acts are usually already handled by some sort of foul / penalty within the game . Hockey , for example , penalizes intentional , violent violations of its rules with varying penalty - box repercussions , suspensions , etc . The fact that specific penalties exist for intentional violent acts is an example of how it * * is * * a part of the game , and it is a part that has been consented to by all parties . Only when it exceeds an extreme , relative level will it become a criminal issue .", "Courts have a long standing precedent to let leagues & sports organizations police themselves and for good reason .

Then the engine would spit out generic outputs , which the API layer would transform into platform - specific graphics and whatnot . Our art teams , meanwhile , would typically have to export all of their materials in a different format for each platform , to best leverage that platform 's graphics system . The advantage of this approach is that you spend less time customizing the game for each platform . The chief disadvantage is that it 's harder to really push the boundaries of what each system can do , and you end up with games that are a bit less ambitious , have less jaw - dropping visuals , and run a bit slower . Higher end studios , like EA Sports , probably put a LOT more money into customizing games for each platform . This is also really only true of the large - format platforms : Xbox , PC , etc .

Just work on a solution for one of these components . There are however situations in which these components can not be . To conceptualize such a component ( API ) , you have to make a contract in which that component communicates or functions ( ABI ) . If the differences between components are too vast , then the contract would need to change to satisfy all components . This is why sometimes to support another target you must first break an existing one . What you 'll often find is that as you support more targets your contract tends to get more vague . This is a major pain in the ass . Another more obvious example is performance . Video game consoles , computers , hand - held devices , etc all tend to vary quite drastically in how they function internally .

For extra security , a huge pool of water is generally over the rods to absorb errant radiation and cool the rods should trouble arise . Storing the energy does not happen . It 's being created so it can be used nearly immediately . The energy that was stored came in the form of Uranium and other elements forged in the bellies of supernovae billions of years ago and trillions of miles away from us .

The Nuclear part is a set of radioactive and nonradioactive rods ( in 1970s technology ) which when set in an array get hot through the reaction , to heat water to make steam to turn a turbine . The rods are set up so as to be raised or lowered to intensify or reduce those reactions , along with insulating material to control the rate of those radioactive reactions and to control the heat created .

The internal fuel portion of a nuclear reactor is uranium dioxide , enriched approximately 3 - 4 % , and contained in a fuel rod , which is a part of a fuel assembly containing typically 90 - 120 rods . A fuel cell contains 4 fuel assemblies , which are permanently in place unless a refuel cycle is occurring . The control rod , which contains neutron absorbing elements such as Boron or Hafnium , are moved in and out of the fuel cell to control the number of reactions occurring at any given time . Neutrons love Boron and Hafnium , even more than U-235 - which is why the control rods are made of such elements . It is the free neutrons that produce the nuclear reactions , not the protons . The two common reactor types are boiling water reactor and pressurized water reactor . At a PWR , the water does not boil . The water is kept at such a high pressure that boiling is prohibited and the heat generated by the fuel burn is transferred to a secondary volume thru a steam generator , which boils and turns your turbine . BWRs send water up thru the fuel assemblies , removing the heat generated , boiling and converting to steam by the exit of the top of the fuel assembly . The wet steam goes thru a moisture separator and dryer and off to spin the turbine and make electricity . Nuke plants are very stable once they 're operating . Typically a plant will stay online continuously for 18 - 24 months depending on type of fuel used .

The receiver generates the audible tone , essentially based on how far the tuner is off the transmitting frequency . If you 're 1kHz off you 'll hear a 1kHz tone . If there are multiple transmitters close to the same frequency then you might be able to hear them all and have to distinguish them with your ear .

Now , why the farm - style ones have so many blades , I 'm not sure . My guess is efficiency is not a concern , so it may have more to do with increasing durability . It 's a small windmill so the cost is n't much greater to have more blades ( and I think they 're very simple metal blades ) , but it may be costly in manual effort to repair .

Please explain like I'm five.", "context": "", "outputs": ["There are a few of things that make Chernobyl still far more radioactive than Hiroshima and Nagasaki . First , the bombs actually did n't use very much radioactive material , all things considered . A nuclear reactor consumes much greater quantities of fuel than does a bomb , since the bomb is made to go BOOM and then be done with while the reactor needs a long , energetic , sustained reaction . Second , the fissile material in the atomic bombs was vaporized . I do n't mean that it disappeared , completely , but I mean was turned into plasma in the explosion . This pushed it much higher in the atmosphere and spread out the material over a huge distance . Without large concentrations , what little radioactive decay takes place over time ( remember that U235 and P239 have fairly long half lives and do n't release a ton of highly energetic particles when they do decay ) quickly became nominal compared to the standard background radiation . Third , very little of the fuel actually turned into the more dangerous radioactive intermediates . The percentages of the fuel actually consumed in those bombs is minute - more modern nuclear weaponry may leave longer lasting radiation . So that 's what happened in the bomb areas - Big releases of radiation at the time of explosion , but not much retained in the soil and region afterwards . In Chernobyl , on the other hand , large quantities of highly radioactive material were released into the atmosphere because of the heat from the fire generated . This includes radioactive steams ( heavy water ) , irradiated metals , intermediates , large quantities of spent and active fuels , the works . These were concentrated on the town , and were n't largely consumed in a big nuclear boom - most of those materials do n't actually go boom either . As a result of the varying half lives and the extremely large quantities of material in the area , it 's still very radioactive , especially near the core which got a logarithmically greater dose than the surrounding areas .", "Firstly , one was a bomb , and the other was a powerplant . With the Hiroshima bomb , the nuclear reaction was a high yield , but quick acting nuclear explosion . Since the Chernobyl was a power plant , it was designed for longer lasting , but small yielding , nuclear reactions .

Non colorblind people need to use 3 flashlights in order to match the color . This is because the wavelength receptors do n't always have the same level of sensitivity . Since we are all pretty much unique individuals , it would be safe to assume that not everyone 's eyes pick things up in the exact same way . The color blindness is an extreme example of this .

I come more from the advertising side so I understand that part a bit better . Facebook makes money the same way Google predominantly makes money : through targeted advertising . Facebook allows you to target their ads based off keywords found in user profiles . For example , I used to have to sell a Dexter costume for Halloween . I would obviously target if a person liked the show Dexter , but I also might target Showtime , CSI , and male ages 18 - 34 . These are all sort of related to each other and roughly fit the demographic that watches Dexter . I might even include other Showtime shows like Weeds or Californication to capture as much of that market as possible . Facebook works on a CPC ( Cost per click ) basis so everytime someone clicks on one of our ads , we pay FB an amount of money that is based on what key words are present in the person 's profile who clicked . \" Dexter \" specifically may cost less than \" Showtime \" which is a bit broader and thus covers more people . The more targeted and minute the term used , the less it generally costs . A term like TV , Food , or Sexy would be so broad that it covers a lot of people , but also costs more per click to use . On the other side , FB also has created \" credits \" which people buy for real money . They can then use these credits to purchase tractors in Farmville , weapons in Mafia Wars , or a limitless other number of online knick knacks found in social games . Facebook takes a cut out of each credit purchased so this is an alternative income for them . The third avenue that is very new for them is in local deal placement . This is essentially just like sites like Groupon or livingsocial . ELI5 : Facebook has three ways to make money . They make money first by looking at what you like . They can then show you ads that are just like the things that you like . So if you say you like Nickelodeon , they may show you a way to go look at and buy posters of Spongebob . Every time you go and look at this other place that sells posters of Spongebob , facebook is being paid by the store owner of Spongebob posters . They also make money whenever you are playing your online games like farmville . When you ask your mom or dad to buy you that super fast tractor or those plants that give you lots of food , your mom and dad have to spend real money to get that for you . They give some of this money to facebook . Facebook also makes money by helping you and all your friends find something fun to do . Sometimes they tell you about a really cool place you might want to try , but you have to get all your friends together first to go there . If you can get all your friends together and all buy a pass to go to this cool place , facebook makes a little money from being the person that told you about it from the place you are going to .

During a regular TV show the viewer most likely sits on the couch and endures the ads - several commercials at a time . In streaming the viewer is typically at a computer watching the show . In that case the viewer can navigate away from a commercial pretty easily and come back to the show after it begins again . They can even rewind the show so if they leave while the commercial is playing and come back after the show 's been running for a few minutes they can still rewind it easily enough . To thwart the viewer from leaving , the TV - streaming service will shorten the ad breaks to just 1 or two commercials . This makes it less troublesome to a viewer to sit and watch than a normal 5 minute break on regular TV . But , the shorter commercial break means fewer ads from a less interested viewer base . Therefore , less money from the advertisers . Services like Hulu and Netflix pay a flat fee to run shows in syndication . Other than the licensing fee the TV stations do n't make money . In summary , TV stations get better ad revenue from their over - the - air broadcast than they do from their streaming service ( like their website ) . They get significantly more money from broadcast than they do from Netflix or online - streaming . If you look at Netflix 's lineup you see they have a lot of showtime and HBO shows . That 's because those channels ca n't run their shows in syndication on normal TV ( cussing , sex , violence , etc ) . They also do n't generate ad revenue . HBO and Showtime also know that most shows wo n't do well selling box sets of the seasons ( most people do n't really care to buy TV series in seasons ) . So the best option for them is to put the TV series on Netflix and get the licensing fees . TL;DR : TV stations make money off ads and a listening viewer base .

We take theories as fact , but they 're not technically speaking laws . A scientific law is , according to my teacher , something which can be logically deduced and therefore irrefutable .", "It 's a little tricky to describe but this is my ( fairly basic - I 'm not a professional scientist ) understanding of it : A law is an \" explanation \" of a natural behavior , usually in the form of one or more mathematical equations . I put \" explanation \" in quotes because it does n't explain it in human terms . It does not answer the question \" why does this happen ? \" only provides the mathematical proof that it does and can be tested and reproduced using the formulas provided . A theory is the human term explanation , maybe more like a description . It explains why something happens and can describe its behavior in a way people can understand better than a math formula . This is part of why we have only laws for some things or only theories for others . There are some phenomena that exist that we have both theories and laws for , like gravity . There is both a theory of gravity and a law of gravity . The theory of gravity explains why things fall down when you throw them up and the law provides the mathematical formula for it . We can clearly see evolution happening and can describe its behavior with a lot of great detail , but we ca n't quite put it into formulaic terms ( the complexity associated in doing this hurts my brain ) . So there 's a theory of evolution , but not a law . Neither is more or less important than the other , neither is more or less correct , either . Hypothesis are what are arguable and go through rapid changes before we have a full understanding . Hypothesis are what potentially become theories and laws . Once something has become a theory or law , it 's as factually correct as scientists can verify it at that time .

Each wave has slightly different characteristics . The frequency is how \" scrunched together \" the ups and downs are . Lines that go up and down very quickly over a short period are \" high frequency . \" Another characteristic is the amplitude - how high and low those ups and downs are . Lines that go waay up high and then waaay down low have a \" high amplitude \" The wave that 's being emitted from the tower is made to produce waves that are ONLY in that pattern ( this is called \" modulation \" ) . When your radio is receiving signals from the radio tower , it 's listening for a specific pattern based on either amplitude or frequency .

The wire in that person 's headphones just happen to pick up the frequency of a nearby radio station . Wires are covered in rubber ( which blocks the signal ) to stop this from happening , but apparently that 's not working in this case .", "Remember how in your middle / high school science class they taught you how if a wire gets close to a magnetic field it can induce a current ? Well ... guess what radio waves are ? They 're a magnetic field that fluctuates in reaction to a sound source , like say a microphone . A radio antenna is just a long thin wire that 's sensitive enough to get a current when the radio waves hit it . Your radio then amplifies that current and pumps it in to a speaker , and since it 's fluctuating the same way the original wave was , the speaker ends up making the same noises the microphone captures on the other end . You know what else has a long thin wire hooked up to an amplifier and some speakers ? Your headphones . Electrically speaking your headphones / speakers are extremely similar to a radio - the only differences is that a ) you have no apparatus for tuning the frequency and b ) the headphones are usually receiving a stronger signal that overpowers any radiowaves that get picked up ( ie , the computer or whatever that you have the headphones plugged in to ) . Every now and then you get lucky ( or unlucky ) and radio waves DO overpower the local signal for whatever reason , and that 's when you hear radio in your ears . Nicer headphones / speakers get around this by using proper shielding on their cables - basically a light foil that 's wrapped around inside the insulation and blocks any radio waves from hitting the actual wires . However , even with shielding a sufficiently strong signal might still get through . For example , if I accidentally leave my cell phone too closer to my speakers I 'll sometimes audibly hear my text messages go out .", "Speakers are essentially a loop of wire next to a magnet . running a current through the wire creates an electromagnet which is attracted to or repulsed by the magnet . Which is what makes the speaker move and create sound . A radio signal can be picked up by any wire , converting to electricity in the wire ( that is how an antenna works ) . So a radio signal , if strong enough , will create an electric current in the wire in the speaker , making a sound . That is why for example speakers makes a noise if you call someone on your mobile phone too close to a speaker . In the case of your link , that is a microphone , which is kind of a speaker in reverse . The thing is that the electric current generated in a normal microphone is really weak . So it 's amplified a lot in the computer for it to be heard . But as I explained , every wire is essentially an antenna , so the wire between your headset and computer will pick up radio signals . I 'm guessing the guy lives really close to the radio station if he can actually hear what it picks up and not just get noise . I had a similar problem when I got an extension cord for my microphone . It made it completely useless as the longer cord picked up a lot of static ."], "input_length": 22, "output_length": 213.33333333333334, "length": 235.33333333333334, "all_classes": "null", "language": "en", "dataset": "longform_qa", "_id": "e4e6f5961a7d21fd0480fce69880e06919f5d70d5137b626875d9021a850b75e"}

When the group reaches 50 people , there is less than a 1 % chance that two people will * not * share a birthday .

You might have one chief who is in charge or organizes things , but this is more authority than wealth . It may be based on group consensus , physical strength , or hunting ability , but there is no way to accumulate stuff so as to be able to \" hire \" people . Wealth started with agriculture . Suddenly , not everyone had to be employed in the procurement of food 24/7 . Also , people were stationary , so they could build solid houses and accumulate stuff .

If someone could confirm that that would be great ) Most satellites are destined for geostationary orbit , which is by far the easiest place to manage space traffic . Due to the way geostationary orbit works , any satellite in that orbit will always be at the same height , going the same speed , and in the same direction . Ignoring small perturberances to a satellite 's orbit , you could theoretically line up satellites into a huge conga line that stretches around the Earth , and have it fly around forever without any satellites colliding . In a way , that 's kind of how it works . There is a line of satellites in geostationary orbit stretching around the Earth , filled with all of the gps satellites , all the satellite TV and radio satellites , communications satellites carrying internet traffic , etc , all separated by miles of space between each satellite of course . When someone wants to launch a satellite into geostationary orbit , they pick a spot in this giant conga line and register their choice with the US Navy , then they carefully fly their satellite into its slot in geostationary orbit . Of course , no orbital placement is perfect , and satellites might drift out of their slots , but when that happens , each satellite has on board propulsion systems that can move the satellite back into position . When the satellite is old and outdated , the satellite is usually moved into a higher orbit , called a graveyard orbit , where satellites go to die , and its spot in the conga line goes to another satellite . Other satellites that do n't go into geostationary orbit are usually much harder to control , however , they are watched religiously by workers on the ground . Before any satellite launches , simulations of the satellite 's orbit over its entire lifetime is run , to ensure that the planned orbit will not collide with any other satellites at the same altitude . If a satellite drifts out of its orbit at any time , controllers on the ground will always be there to steer it back into position . Typically when the lifetime for these low orbit satellites is over , they reenter the atmosphere and burn up , ensuring that it does n't become space junk .", "The radius of earth is roughly 6400 km .

Explain like I'm five.", "context": "", "outputs": ["Alright , so first you need to know what a solute is and what a solvent is . A solvent is usually what there 's more of . It 's what you start out with . The solute is what you put in the solvent . For example , if you had water and food dye , and you wanted to make orange water ( do n't ask me why ) , water would be your solvent and the orange dye would be your solute - because you put the dye in the water , not vice versa . A mixture of solute and solvent is known as a solution . Now let 's talk about concentration . For something to be ' concentrated ' simply means that there is relatively more solute in the solvent than there is in some other solution . So say I put 5 drops of orange dye in a litre of water and call it Beaker 1 . And then I put 20 drops of orange dye in another litre of water , and call it Beaker 2 . Beaker 2 is more concentrated than beaker one , because there is more solute ( dye ) dissolved in the same amount of solvent ( water ) . Onto osmosis , using a real life example . So a plant is chillin ' in the ground . The plant is using the awesomeness that is photosynthesis to make a bunch of sugar . In the stem of this plant , there 's a ton of sugar ( solute ) and not a lot of water ( solvent - FYI water is always a solvent ) . In the earth / soil that the plant 's roots are chillin ' in , the opposite is true - not a lot of plant sugars , but there is a lot of water . So the stem is much more concentrated than the earth . Osmosis seeks to maintain an EQUILIBRIUM - equal amount of solvent and solute on either side of the membrane . The membrane is simply what separates the two regions of differing concentrations , and here it is the outside layer ( cell wall ) of the plant . So , in order to achieve this equilibrium , the water in the earth moves past the membrane into the plant stem , so as to dilute the solute ( sugars ) in the stem . Thus , with this addition of water , the inside of the stem is no longer more concentrated than the earth outside of it .

' Depends on the realm in question . In some cases the nobility was just about as good as locked down - it was basically never the case that a commoner could become a landowner or holder of titles . In some realms a noble might grant nobility to some degree or another for military accomplishments , or simply because they liked that person . > What powers and responsibilities were granted to those of noble families ? Again , varies realm to realm . A duke , count or whatever might be charged with defending the realm from the other kingdom that bordered their lands . Some were charged with meeting quotas for food harvested or for providing soldiers . Some held the power to , along with the other gentry , select the king or depose him . Some realms had - at least on paper - royal families for all time that could never be deposed or overruled .

As for the nobles , I suspect that in many cases they would 've been conquering invaders whose descendants remained a specialized noble / warrior class .

Then you have a knightly or warrior caste emerging . The Normans are an example . They were Viking invaders who raided France . Then the French king gave some of the Vikings land in return for helping to defend France against other Viking raiders . So the Viking Normans became French nobles .

More interestingly , this system is * entirely * European . Other cultures created nobility in very different ways .

If you shine a while light on green paint , it absorbs everything but green light , so your eye sees green light . Now the complex part is when you combine them . When you combine lights , your eyes are getting more and more light , so you 're getting closer to white . But when you combine paints and then shine white light on them , the more paint you combine means the more light is absorbed by the paint , so the less light actually reaches your eye , so you get closer to black .

If you 're living your day to day life and are then faced with an uncomfortable decision ( should I lie , or should I let the woman die ) , you should n't feel pressured to do something that is wrong . With other people it becomes a case of \" If you do n't do a minor wrong ( lying ) then you are responsible for the greater wrong ( the woman 's death ) . \" Kant pretty much says \" fuck that ... I was just minding my own damn business when this woman ran into my house . It was the husband that stabbed her , not I. I should be pressured into doing something wrong , minor as it may be . I 'm not responsible for what happened * at all * . He is . \" I do n't agree with him , but it 's an interesting take on things . It 's like the idea that * you * are functioning properly , and should n't be forced to do something wrong because other people are n't functioning properly . That 's the third maxim . First is the idea that an act will always have the same moral value , no matter what , regardless of context . Second is to not treat other people as objects to achieve your goals .

So , one of the Valar , a bad guy named Morgoth , captured some elves and tried to use them to create his own \" children \" - but they were a perversion of the elves , lesser in every way . These \" children \" are the orcs that continue to live on well after Morgoth 's departure from the world . Sauron and Saruman continue to use them as armies . These orcs live in the darkest places of earth , like Moria , and some of them could n't stand being out in daylight ( though Saruman bred some that could handle it ) . The reason they lose all the time is because ( 1 ) they initially did n't do too well in the sun , ( 2 ) they 're not as smart as elves because they 're a cheap copy , ( 3 ) they do n't have love or any other driving force to help motivate them to really TRY to win , and finally , because it is suggested in Tolkien 's works that when it counts , * when it really counts * , the Valar and Maiar kind of step in and help out a little bit . Gandalf , for example , lends great power and wisdom to the armies of elves and men throughout the War of the Rings , and some of the goodness and power of the valar still run through the earth and water of Arda . It 's some supernatural shit . ( Edit : for example , this is partially why the ringwraiths ( black riders ) are so hesitant to chase after Frodo when Arwen / Glorfindel carries him across the Bruinen , they do n't want to go into the water , because the spirit of the Vala , Ulmo , still resides in some of the waters of Middle Earth ) .

The U.S. Military is called in , but rather than rescue the survivors , they appear to be under orders to kill all witnesses to the event . Gordon survives , eventually traveling to Xen , and kills a creature that was keeping the portals open . At the end , a mysterious gentlemen referred to as \" G - Man \" ( a slang expression for a federal agent ) is shown to be holding Gordon Freeman in a prison cell between worlds , where he will remain until the G - Man needs him again . At the start of Half - Life 2 , the G - Man 's face appears , and a short speech implies that Gordon has been called into service by the G - Man . What this service might be is a mystery . Gordon gains consciousness on a train , pulling into City 17 , which is presumably somewhere in eastern Europe . A large screen at the train depot shows the face and voice of Dr. Breen , the old Administrator of the Black Mesa facility , who apparently gained power by negotiating Earth 's surrender to the Combine , a race of aliens .

Communism relies on the individuals ' realization that we depend on each other , and thus have common interests that we have to work toward . If I raise chickens and you grow grain , we need to exchange our goods to each have a healthy diet . In essence , we cooperatively \" own \" the goods we create and we share them . So long as you and I realize that we 're better off when we cooperate , we both are healthy ( and have homes , and all the other goods that come from being a conscientious producer of goods and services ) . However . This spirit of community can be hurt by the lures of competition . If I withhold some of my goods , or try to get as much from you as I can for as little labor as I can put it ( i.e. laziness ) , then the system of cooperation starts to fail . If Bob , Susan , and I help you build your house , and then you give us none of your grain in return , we no longer have a healthy diet . In order for the system to work , you must have people realize that it only works when they believe in the system and help support the ethos through work . Some people believe communism is \" so bad \" because within such a system you ca n't want to have the biggest house , or the fanciest car , and so on . Also , some infamous societal failures in history are often associated with communism , even though they were n't really communist countries . So sometimes when people hear \" communism \" they think of those terrible events in history . For a five year old , you could also think of it like this : We drive cars , and we have lots of rules for car drivers like stopping at a stop sign . It would probably be a good idea to stop at intersections , even if we did n't have stop signs or laws regulating them , as it would make driving safer for everyone . We would be cooperating for the good of everyone . But some people break those driving rules , out of their own personal interest , and so we need ( numerous ) laws ( i.e. external forces , not internal conscientousness ) to guide our behavior .

Example : eating rare steak is fine , but chicken must be cooked all the way through Please explain like I'm five.", "context": "", "outputs": ["The things you need to keep in mind are : * the structure of the meat i.e. how its cells are arranged . * the living environment of the original create e.g. caught in the wild , or raised on a farm . * the types of parasites / pathogens that the creatures are likely to be exposed to . The structure of the meat is important because it determines how easily / deeply any pathogen ( e.g. salmonella , e.coli ) can penetrate into the meat . For example chicken meat is basically a sponge . This means things like salmonella can penetrate deeply into the meat , which means you must cook the meat thoroughly in order to ensure safety ( the risk is low , but high enough to warrant this precaution ) . Beef on the other hand ( whole cuts at least ) are practically bulletproof as far as meats go . This is why you can have beef tartare , or steaks with barely a sear . The risk is comparatively much lower overall , and even if there is any harmful bacteria , it is unable to penetrate deeply into the meat - allowing you to quickly sear the meat and leave the center raw without any problems . This is also why you can easily dry age beef with few problems Ground / mince beef is technically riskier , but compared to most other meats the risk is very low ( hence tartare is on the menu ) . Fish , pork , and all wild meats can contain parasites ( with varying degrees of risk ) , which means extra care must be taken before safe consumption . Bear is so risky it is never eaten raw , while venison can be cooked to a lower temperature if handled properly beforehand . Raw fish is fine because most commercial sold fish is frozen beforehand to kill off any parasites . The same is done with pork generally , but because pork meat is still more \" spongy \" like chicken rather than \" layered \" like beef - you still have to cook thoroughly to remove the risk of bacterial contamination . Pork however can be safely dry cured when raw , as long as you use salt , sodium nitrite ( to prevent botulism ) , and the right environmental conditions ( temp / humidity ) for the cure to take place safely . Hence why you have salamis and serrano / prosciutto crudo ham . Overall - the important thing to remember is that * there is a reason * these recommendations exist * .

Soon , American farmers were producing more corn than people in the country could eat , so we had to come up with ways to use corn without simply cooking it up an eating it . Later on , we 'd start using it to make corn syrup to sweeten things , and a version of plastic that was less bad for the earth , but before all of that the simplest way to get rid of our extra corn was to make liquor out of it . We had so much cheap corn that people made a lot of liquor , and when you have a lot of something , you ca n't charge too much for it , because people can always buy it somewhere else for cheaper . So before prohibition , the price for liquor made out of booze was really low . It was , in fact , the cheapest drink available in most places , so people drank it all the time .

That 's how I 've always thought of e. Basically , it 's a base unit that all other growing systems can use ( that 's why it 's used in the \" natural log \" ) . It 's also why we use e to describe ALL systems that have a growth rate ( like spirals , snail shells , interest , radioactive decay , and populations ) . The spiral on a snail 's shell is has radial growth outward , interest compounds regularly . As long as it has a constant growth rate , you can describe it with e. Think of it like this : If you have a circle , any circle , it 'll always meet the same properties as a The Unit Circle ( angles will always be the same , the equations will be the same ) . It 's radius - to - diameter ratio will always equal pi . The same way in a growing system . It will always have certain properties and those properties will always be able to be described by scaling e ( just multiplying , dividing by e ) .

With alcohol and benzos , that chemical imbalance can be serious enough to kill you . Edit ; as others have corrected me , I figured I 'd add this for clarity . My post is mostly right , but backwards . The brain does n't stop making chemicals . It makes way too much , and the alcohol stops the chemicals from working as much .

Overtime , you brain can get used to this effect and stop producing natural chemicals that work to depress brain activity . This is physical addiction . When someone strongly physically addicted to alcohol abruptly stops , nothing is there to counter the brain 's normal excitability , since it has stopped making depressants due to the chronic presence of alcohol . This excitability can continue uncontrolled and is responsible for many of the symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal , such as seizures , which ultimately may lead to the alcoholic 's death . You can avoid the serious withdrawal symptoms by slowly tapering off the amount you drink .", "ELI5 answer : Alcohol is a depressant and affects the brain by decreasing brain activity . With extended alcohol use , the brain tries to balance this effect by increasing its own excitatory activity . When alcohol use is abruptly stopped , the brain can not adjust quickly enough and that leads to withdrawal due to hyperactivity of the brain . Physically , this typically starts with increased blood pressure , heart rate , and respiration later leading to confusion , delirium , and seizures , and can ultimately lead to death if not properly treated . People in withdrawal are treated by giving them alcohol or medications that act the same way ( benzodiazepines ) so that they can slowly be weaned off .

It originally meant a building that was open to the public to come and relax , socialise and most importantly consume alcohol . Noawadays the name public house means a building owned by a brewery , run by a tenant , for the sale and consumption of alcohol . In UK law you must have a license to sell alcohol , a license to have it consumed on your ( public commercial ) premises and another personal license to facilitate this sale . A pub in the UK is owned by the brewery . They have a tenant that buys the business within the building and then gets to keep the profit made from the sale in exchange for meeting the brewery 's minimum sale requirements . They must buy beer from the brewery and if they do n't buy enough they will be kicked out and another tenant will be found . This leads to , in more recent times , more pubs shutting down due to the aggressive nature of breweries . However you can also have free houses ( woohoo ) which are owned and run by the same person . They are open to buy beer from wholesale shops at a much cheaper price than would otherwise be available through the brewery . This means freehouses generally are cheaper than pubs and can have a different clientele . A bar is normally much more about alcohol than socialising . In a pub it is totally fine , in fact often expected , to sit at the bar with your drink and talk to the other people at the bar . You are of course not looked down upon by finding a private area , that is your choice , but it is often polite to stay and chat for a while . Bars are more aimed at limiting the bar area to sale only , once you have your drink you leave and go back to your private area and socialise mainly with those that you came out with . Pubs will often provide entertainment such as music , darts , snooker and/or pool , with snacks and occasionally food served too . Bars also open different hours to pubs .

I 'm from New York . You 've gotten some good answers , but maybe I can help go more in - depth . The very first thing to remember is that in more expensive cities , wages rise with cost inflation . Now , it 's not a perfect scale-- most of the cost inflation comes because many people are * very * rich , not necessarily because the poor are less poor . However , it 's still a factor-- there are fewer minimum wage jobs , and/or you 're more likely to get a job whose wages are above the federal minimum . In other words , chances are the same job netting you $ 7.25 in Nebraska will get you around $ 10 in NYC . Now that 's not 100 % true . There are still * some * minimum wage jobs here . How do people get by ? Well , about like anywhere else , I suppose . They do n't get to enjoy many aspects of the city where inflation has taken hold . They do n't get to go out to dinner at the nice restaurants or go drinking in NYC bars . They ca n't go to Whole Foods , they have to go to cheaper grocery stores . They have to curb themselves more , and * * they get government assistance * * like anywhere else . Remember , the farther you go from NYC the cheaper things get , so many times people will live far away from the city if they do n't make a lot . And if they 're living far away from the city , and working a minimum wage job ... they can just as easily find one near where they live .

Matter of fact I ca n't think of a single minimum wage job I 've had , and I 've made the rounds as a student . Office worker , busboy , waiter , receptionist ... they all paid around $ 10 . And one last thing to remember : The cost of living does n't * have * to be high in this city . It 's totally doable on less money . The reason it seems higher is that it * can * be higher . And most people making very little tend to have a social circle where people make standard ( remember how I said there are n't many minimum wage jobs here ?

This obviously does not jive well . The servers crash , and everyone is angry . Blizzard continues to get the servers running again for about 3 days , when the server load goes down to around the number they expect . Everyone is still mad , but not everyone is trying to play at once and the system is running smoothly . Most people forget about the whole thing and play the game as expected within a week . The cost of buying a lot of servers is not justified for the few day rush when a game comes out .", "As a whole it is not worth it to plan for a ' flawless day one release ' .

Or can you just get away with a 770Ti and chug along at 80 frames anyways ? Wasted processing power is wasted money . Blizzard on WoD release also had another issue that they wrote a small article about and they did do server upgrades to accommodate for it . Their subscriber base jumped nearly 3 million over a quarter of a fiscal year . Setting up new infrastructure for that to be the new baseline is a nightmare in and of itself considering that many of those accounts could be legacy accounts ( pre URL_0 standardization ) . In the days following the release blizzard fired up their free account times and tried to maintain open contact with irate customers . After the initial tidal wave of customers however , things have been pretty smooth across the board . Server transfers were opened and taken , and players are chugging through content . TLDR : do nt waste time with ' flawless for a minute ' use your time on what works in the long run .", "They could account for it , but they would need a massive number of servers , an order of magnitude more bandwidth , etc .

If you want something that can handle 2 million people around the world simultaneously trying to connect and use an application that is latency - sensitive , you need some serious hardware , bandwidth , support from competent data centers and service providers , and a solid anycast infrastructure with geographic diversity .

The idea is that space , time , matter and energy existed in an ultra dense , ultra tiny point , and then just expanded until it was the size of the universe How or why any of that stuff actually got there is not answered by the big bang theory A much better ( in my opinion ) theory ( though it is still just a theory ) is inflation theory . Maybe a physicist can explain this properly , but what i got from reading brian green is basically this - At the beginning of the universe was an Inflaton field ( again , the theory can not explain how it got there ) . The inflaton field is beleived to be like a magnetic field , except it exists throughout the entire universe and has equal energy everyway ( maybe : s ) . Basically the Inflaton field existed in an ultra high energy state , and like boiling water , frothed around differant energy values . When a part of the field the size of a football ( apparently ) reached a certain value ( because it was bouncing around lots of values ) , that football sized chunk expanded a mind buggering distance at a ball flattening speed . This happened essentially because that s just the way the field is - when it hits that value it just does that Special relativity states that all mass is actually like a condensed lump of energy ( lots of energy ) , and this inflaton field had a really appalling amount of energy . As it expanded , it cooled down , and as it cooled down the various fundamental components of nature crystallised . Kind of like the boiling water freezing and forming ice crystals . The awesome part of all this is that the theory has offered testable predictions which have been confirmed ( like the pattern of microwave energy left behind across the universe ) and the theory implies that the universe 's actual size is so huge that the actual part we can see ( we can see quite a lot of stuff bty ) is to that whole universe as a grain of sand is to the earth . Also there maybe lots of universes - not parallel like in sci - fi movies , but floating around in bubbles and bumping into each other That 's the best i can do .

Democrats feel that if you give extra money to rich people they are only going to spend it on rich people things and that wo n't benefit poor people at all . Republicans are the opposite .

Think about little kids trying to share toys : when one decides he wants what the other has , he just takes it , because that 's what he wants . He ca n't understand yet that the other child has wants too , and that those wants matter just as much as his own . If he hurts the other child , he does n't really understand the concept of \" sorry , \" because he 's not old enough yet to understand hurting other people .

Collectors often buy up work of elderly artists , anticipating their death ( a bit macabre , but it 's true ! ) , and then flood the market . Supply exceeds demand & value drops . Artist estates can also be guilty of flooding ( eg , family members sell off large numbers of works left behind in the studio , many of which are of inferior quality ; there 's a reason those paintings did n't sell in 50 years ! ) A sensible dealer or auction house will manage the supply to heighten demand , and build up prices slowly . But you do n't have to die ! Having a major exhibition at a respected institution helps raise value , as does winning awards and participating in group exhibitions . Increasing the profile of the artist increases the price . Growing artistically & reinvention is important , too . Different periods in an artist 's career are often valued differently , which a sense of demand when that artist no longer works in the same style or subject matter . When exhibiting , do n't exhibit too many works at once ; if there are 100 works available , collectors are less inclined to buy at the start of the exhibition , because they know lots will be left over at the end & they 'll be able to get a discount on the price . The more works left unsold , the higher discount a collector will demand & they 'll be more likely to get it . Source : valuing & selling art has been my job for the past decade ...

In fact , you could just as easily use a cut of plywood and some cinder blocks to stabilize your mattress .", "The mattress will last longer because it will be supported properly . The important thing that some people are missing is that you should definitely replace an old box spring with a new one . If you 'd rather use a platform bed , put it directly on the ground , etc . that 's fine . But if you 're going to use a box , use the box designed for your mattress for these reasons : 1 . Boxes are designed to work with the mattress they 're sold with . It 's fairly simple technology , but there have been changes over the past 10 years or so that matter , so do n't use an old one with a new mattress . 2 . Because the box matters , your warranty will usually be voided if you use the wrong box . If your decision to save a little bit of money effects the longevity of the mattress , the manufacturer is n't going to subsidize that decision by honoring the warranty . 3 . Even if your old box is the correct kind and you do n't care about the warranty , the boxes wear down over time . The purpose of a box is to provide an even , supportive foundation for your mattress . It should flex slightly and help distribute pressures exerted on the sleep system . As this happens over time , it performs less well , causing the mattress to be less supported and to deal with more strain overall . 4 . Even if you do n't care that a worn out box might increase the rate at which your mattress wears , a worn out box could break prematurely . As the stresses are applied to the box it will slowly break down . Any day it could hit the critical point and a major component could break . At this point you 'd most likely want to buy a new one . You 'd go find the cheapest one possible . Then in a couple years you 'd replace the mattress again , but not the box , since you \" just \" replaced it . This cycle will continue forever and will cause you to have to make twice as many trips ( and potentially pay for twice as many deliveries ) as otherwise . 5 . The majority of the cost is on the mattress , not the box . If you 're going to pay for the mattress , it 's usually worth it to know that you do n't have to worry about anything for the next 10 years and pay for the box as well .", "That depends on the type of boxspring that you have . Modern mattresses are designed to be placed on a solid foundation . If your current boxspring is a sturdy foundation that does n't flex at all , you might be fine ( though an inspector might disagree if you make a warranty claim . ) If you have an older style boxspring that had actual springs in it , it needs to be replaced because that is n't a solid support .

It can be done with something that binds oxygen very tightly , but then how to release the oxygen so it can be breathed in ? Also , getting the total pressure of the air correct so that it can be breathed properly would be difficult . There is even less nitrogen in the water than oxygen .

Explain like I'm five.", "context": "", "outputs": ["Cancer is an abnormal , uncontrolled growth of your own cells in the body . This can occur anywhere . The main problem is that cancer does not consist of other ( so called ' foreign ' ) cells , like bacteria , but of your own . Due to an excessive growth of these cells , more cells are being created every 24 hours ( or minute , whatever time period you choose ) , than die in that same period . This will create a lump . There are two main differentiations to make between cancers : benignent and malignant . Benignent means that the tumor is still located in one place , surrounded by a little film , if you will , that keeps it in place , and more importantly prevents the cells from getting out . Depending on where this is located , the prognosis for this is good ( it is possible to differentiate between the types with a microscopic sample , or biopt ) . Easier to reach = better prognosis . Malignant means that some of the cancer cells have breached the little layer on top , or that the layer is not in place . These cells can then travel through the lymphatic system into your blood and spread elsewhere through your body . They can then form a new tumor there . This is called metastasis , and severely curbs the prognosis . The xkcd comic is about malignant forms of cancer , because , like Randall said , there is indeed no way to make sure that there are no cancer cells left in the body . Until 6 months later , when there is either a new ( small ) tumor or not . Benignent cancer , is not that bad . It can be treated , and after treatment the only problem can be that it returns- because you are more sensitive towards cancer if you have had it once . The 10 - year survival rate is actually 50 % , not 60 . It differs per form of cancer- colon cancer is one of the worst .", "Cancer is when extra cells grow in your body , and they are n't the right kind of cells . People often say \" cancer \" like its some big scary all - encompassing monster . The reality is that when someone tells you that they have \" cancer , \" they have a specific kind with a fancy medical name based on where it is on their body and what kind of extra cells are growing there . Different kinds of bad cells are worse than others , or are harder to treat because of where they are located .

During that same period , unions were under direct attack from the corporate - funded political right . Many Americans under 40 seem to have almost no concept of common good , let alone how their own government is supposed to work . And all Americans , old and young , have been bombarded with corporate - sponsored anti - tax , anti - federal scapegoating that only seems to be spontaneous grassroots sentiment -- it 's all Astroturf , but few have been able to see that until now .

I 've read that one reason this delineation exists goes back to the Civil War . After the Civil War ended , the USA was faced with tremendous debts from having waged it . What the USA did in order to pay for it ( as is a common practice ) is they made the losers of the war pay for it . This amounted to taxing the South into the ground . If you view from a certain perspective , the mindset makes a certain amount of sense . The USA government viewed an accepted practice of the South ( slavery ) as unacceptable and demanded they stop . When the South declined to do so , and chose to break away from the USA instead , the USA went to war with the South and kicked its collective ass . Then , after the USA defeated the South , the South was forced to pay for the ass - whooping it had received . Not hard to see why people could be bitter about that . As to why that mindset has lasted in that region to this day , I do n't have a spectacular answer short of parents bringing up their kids in that mindset . I view it as something akin to choosing a sports team . If you 're a boy and your dad is a Red Sox fan , odds are you 're going to root for the Red Sox , and similarly with the Yankees .

There are others , like Huffman Encoding if you want to look it up ( which resembles abbreviating words in your notes and keeping track of what the abbreviations mean ) , but they 're all along the same general idea .", "Most of compression works under a simple assumption - most information is redundant or irrelevant and does n't need to be stored . There are two types of compression - lossless ( like ZIP files and RARs and so forth ) and lossy ( JPEG , MPEG , etc ) . Lossless compression uses tricks ( like run - length encoding , which people have mentioned ) to represent the same information with fewer bits . It boils down to the fact that information in an easy to use format is generally pretty verbose . Compression trades \" easy to use \" for \" easy to store . \" Smarter lossless compressors might take into account patterns in the data . For instance , a lossless compressor for English text files would probably want to take into account the frequency of various letters - we use a lot of \" e\"s and not that many \" z\"s . Lossy compression takes this a step further by incorporating the understanding of * how the data will be used * - it generally takes into account that the information will be used by humans . For instance , to compress a picture into a JPEG , you usually throw away a lot of the data corresponding to the color information in the photo . Our eyes are much better at picking up the differences between levels of gray than we are the different colors . Then we apply a variety of techniques to the data to represent it in a compact format . Similarly , audio compression favors frequencies in the source audio that our ears are better at hearing . One odd side effect of this is that other animals ( or aliens or whatever ) would probably look at a raw image and a JPEG and see significant differences , whereas we ca n't really perceive the difference as much .", "Let 's just do a very simple , not particularly great compression algorithm .

Let 's say you have someone who 's a really smart professor ( the processor ) and you want him to help you with a problem . The only thing is that this professor only speaks Russian ( binary or machine code ) . So you get someone who knows Russian but he can only translate that into Spanish ( assembly ) . Now let 's say you know some Spanish , but communicating with the translator that way is just annoying . So you finally get a friend to translate from Spanish to English ( programming languages like C or C++ ) . Basically when programming in a programming language they get translated to harder and harder to understand languages until it gets to just 1 's and 0 's . From there the CPU can then send 1 's or 0 's to other physical parts of the computer ( i.e. the professor can talk to his Russian speaking colleagues who know more about other subjects ) . Technically you could use a English to Russian dictionary to talk to the professor or even learn Russian , but it 's hard to do that and takes time . As a side note though , some people prefer going directly from English to Russian because using a string of translators blurs the lines , and things get mixed up ( i.e. if you code in assembly language , the first step above 1 's and 0 's , you have more direct control over what the computer does compared to C ) .

That part of the machine then does something which causes a chain reaction which ultimately ends in a physical change you can notice . If someone writes some code in what we call a programming language ( e.g. Java , C , Perl , etc . ) , a special program called a compiler takes that code and eventually changes it into a series of 1 's and 0 's . This information is further split into smaller and smaller packets of data until it eventually arrives at a certain component that can read that string of 1s and 0s and generally perform a basic physical action ( e.g. change the voltage on a wire , or change the charge on a metal disk ) . This action again causes a chain reaction in the other direction , until it finally arrives at the physical change you can actually notice .", "In simple terms , that text command , and the code behind it that runs it is represented inside the computer by electrical signals .

For instance , The Tea Party tends to be accurately libertarian when it comes to fiscal - in - the - government issues , but absolutely not very libertarian at all when it comes to social - in - the - government issues . So they want to use the libertarian platform to push their own social agenda ( which tends toward conservatism ) . Actual libertarianism , as anon33249038 stated , is about recognizing people 's rights and the freedom for individuals to choose their actions as long as they 're not encroaching on anyone else 's rights . A good example of this might be drug use ... as long as the individual 's drug use does n't impact someone else 's rights , it is considered a \" victimless crime \" and should not be illegal . Once that drug use begins to encroach on someone else 's rights , there is now a victim , and that victim 's rights should be upheld .", "You might want to read through the answers that have been given the last dozen times someone asked this question .

Anarcho - capitalism is sort of the far end of the spectrum , whose proponents believe the state can be done away with altogether and replaced by private businesses .
